If you intend to use this application in hunting, check first your local game law for legal use. The calls are intended to call in Malard ducks from all kinds of hunting situations. Best results are achieved with an external speaker connected to your phones audio jack (if available).\n\nTo play a call, tap the button with the desired sound. It will then start playing until you hit it again or select another call.\n\n1. The Greeting Call\nUse when you first see ducks at distance.\n\n2. The Hail Call\nA loud call used for distant ducks, As a rule of thumb, don't use the hail call within 100 yards of the ducks you're trying to call. Do not over use.\n\n3. The Lonesome Hen Call\nWhen ducks are call shy, the lonesome hen call can be very effective. If overdone, the lonesome hen call can scare the ducks away.\n\n4. The Feed Call\nUse to add variety to calls, but do not overuse.\n\n5. The Pleading Call\nUsed for flying ducks around 75 to 200 yards away from you. Save this call for ducks who are too stubborn to come in.\n\n6. The Comeback Call\nIf you want a quicker response to your duck call and if ducks don't respond to greeting call.\n\n7. The Quack\nBasic quack sound used to fill at close range\n\nSome Tips for Better Calling from (Rod Haydel)\n- As long as the ducks are coming in, forget calling.\n- When the ducks start an erratic wing beat, hit them with a comeback call immediately to bring them back on line.\n- If they look as if they may drift off-line, use single quacks and feed calls to bring them back online.\n- Try calling at birds as they circle when they quarter into the wind. This will make it easier for them to set up for a landing zone into the wind.\n- When team calling, one person should be the leader while the others just fill in. Don't compete against yourselves.\n- Realize that not all ducks are callable and that even real ducks do not call in all the ducks all the time.\n\n",
