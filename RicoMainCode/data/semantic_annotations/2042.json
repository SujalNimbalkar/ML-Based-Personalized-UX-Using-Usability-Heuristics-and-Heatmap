Nothing has knocked him down,\" Quintero-Velasquez said. \"Today it's a challenge for him to be here, and he's here and he reminds us that we all believe in something because we march with our values of non-violence to spread them to the City of San Antonio.\"Jason Langeway said that he is a math teacher at the KIPP School, and he brought a large group of students to the event to teach them about community involvement first-hand. He believes his group may be a new generation of leaders that can carry forward the cause for which Chavez fought.\"We have a group of high school students here who are energized and enthusiastic and ready to leave a lasting mark on this world at KIPP San Antonio,\" he said.Keith Hom came with a large, enthusiastic group from VIA transit.\"It's very encouraging to see the type of turnout that we're seeing today,\" Hom said.Ylani Hernandez is a student leader at Texas A&M-San Antonio. She said that she was proud to represent her family and her race at the march.\"Just the climate with everything in politics has been really ugly. Communication hasn't been really direct, and I think we're here to let the people know that we're not ready to go away,\" Hernandez said. \"We're not ready for this wall and that we're here to stay.\"As part of the ceremony, Martinez released a flock of doves over the crowd.\"If we're going to win, we have to be non-violent, so let us not destroy personal property when we protest, let us be non-violent,\" he said. \"Let us be peaceful. Let us use the greatest commandment that God gave us: That's love each other, not hate.\"",

Hilton is hosting a #Travelwithpurposecontest where winners receive a free five-night stay in Canopy by Hilton Reykjavik City Centre in Iceland. Marriott International wants its properties to share images of Earth Hour activities on social media. And Fairmont Washington, D.C. will sell a special \"Going Green Martini,\" donating 100% of sales to the World Wildlife Fund.Celebrities like Maroon 5 also are supporting the campaign.We're all in for  #EarthHour .

          "text": "SAN ANTONIO – With 10 games left in the Spurs' regular season, All-Star forward Kawhi Leonard is focused on getting into playoff form against some of the best teams in the NBA over the next two and a half weeks. The Silver and Black play the teams that have met in the Finals each of the past two years, the Cleveland Cavaliers and Golden State Warriors, in back-to-back games Monday and Wednesday, respectively, at the AT&T Center.\"You want to play against the best teams, the best players,\" Leonard said Saturday night after the Spurs won their fourth game in a row with a 106-98 victory over the New York Knicks at the AT&T Center. Leonard scored 29 points and LaMarcus Aldridge and Pau Gasol added 19 each, leading the Silver and Black to a win that kept them within striking distance of Golden State for the top seed in the Western Conference. The Spurs (56-16) trail the Warriors (58-14) by two games, but own the tiebreaker against them by virtue of winning the season series.The Silver and Black went up by 20 against the Knicks when center Dewayne Dedmon scored on a put-back dunk with 9:56 left in the third quarter, but the Knicks trailed by only four (78-74) heading into the final period.New York clawed back into the game by outscoring the Spurs 31-17 in the third quarter, when it shot 56 percent (14/25). The Silver and Black went stone cold in the period, shooting 29.6 percent (8/27) and making only 1 of 7 shots from the 3-point line.Center Willy Hernangomez and guard Derrick Rose, who each scored 24 points to lead the Knicks, had 13 and 10 points, respectively, in the third period. New York All-Star forward Carmelo Anthony missed the game with a sore left knee. The Knicks trimmed the deficit to three, 83-80, on two free throws by Kristaps Porzingis with 9:12 remaining, but that's as close as they got before the Spurs slammed the door shut on their rally.\"I think we had too many defensive breakdowns,\" Gasol said. \"They were getting in the paint pretty easily, which forced us to have to get bodies on their bodies. They got too many easy looks and made the run. Then all of a sudden it was a three-point game.The Spurs took control with their 3-point shooting, hitting 5 of 11 attempts from beyond the arc in the fourth period. Leonard and Patty Mills nailed two each and Gasol made one, putting the Spurs up 106-92 in a span of 5 minutes, 22 seconds. The onslaught sent the Knicks to their fifth consecutive loss. .Mills and Tony Parker each scored 10 points and were the only other Spurs in double figures. New York began its rally after Parker left the game with 9:03 left in the third quarter. Parker was shaken up after getting fouled by Hernangomez, and was escorted to the team's training room by trainer Will Sevening.Parker returned to the bench in a few minutes and went back into the game with 3:51 left in the period. The Knicks, meanwhile, scored eight unanswered points before Aldridge, who had eight points in the third quarter, tipped in a basket with 6:38 left. Parker played nearly seven minutes in the third quarter, but was on the floor for only three in the final period. San Antonio led 33-23 after one quarter and outscored the Knicks 28-20 in the second to go up 61-43 at the half. The Silver and Black outscored New York 28-24 in the fourth quarter.\"We had one period there where we had a bad combination,\" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said, reflecting on the third quarter. \"We couldn't make a shot, and our defense got a little bit poor all at the same time, and that's when they made their run. But it happens in the NBA.\"We've been behind by a lot in games, and you come back. Nobody's immune from that, but I thought they hung pretty tough. And then in the last four, five minutes, the defense stiffened and we made shots at the same time. So we got it done.\"The Spurs played without starting guard Danny Green, who was given the night off by Popovich.and rookie point guard Dejounte Murray, who missed his eighth consecutive game with a groin injury. San Antonio shot 45.5 percent (45/99) for the game, and was 40 percent (10/25) from the 3-point line. Leonard hit 11 of 18 shots, including 4 of 6 from beyond the arc, and added five rebounds, five assists and two blocks.Gasol had another strong performance off the bench, getting his 19 points on 8-of-10 shooting, including 3 of 4 attempts from long distance, and led the Silver and Black with 10 rebounds. He also had three assists and two blocks.Dedmon and Aldridge finished with 13 and 10 rebounds, respectively.Mills hit 4 of 9 shots, including 2 of 5 from the 3-point line, and dished out a game-high seven assists. He drew praise from his teammates and Popovich. \"He brings a lot of energy, and that shot has to be respected,\" Manu Ginobili said. \"He's not the type of player who gets disappointed, or thinks a lot about what his stats are saying about the game. He just keeps playing the same way. He trusts his shot and he makes some big ones.\"The Spurs play six of their last 10 regular-season games at the AT&T Center. Seven of the last 10 will be against playoff teams, including Oklahoma City, Utah (twice), Memphis and Los Angeles Clippers. Five of those seven games will be in San Antonio.\"Each team wants to win right now, wants to get better,\" Leonard said. \"When you've got two teams trying to do that, competing against one another, it just makes both sides better.\"The NBA playoffs start on Saturday, April 15.

Carmelo Anthony (sore left knee) is out for the Knicks. SAN ANTONIO – Talk about two teams going in different directions.The New York Knicks (27-45) have lost almost three times as many games as the Spurs, who at 55-16 still have a chance to finish with the best record in the NBA regular season.The Knicks are on a four-game skid and the Spurs have won their last three.But the Knicks are 1-0 against San Antonio this season, beating the Silver and Black 94-90 Feb. 12 in New York. The loss at Madison Square Garden came midway through the Spurs' annual rodeo road trip.Kawhi Leonard led all scorers with 36 points, but the Silver and Black shot only 36.3 percent (33/91) overall and 20.7 percent (6/29) from the three-point line. Carmelo Anthony, who will miss Saturday night's game with a sore knee, paced the Knicks with 25 points. They hit 50 percent (34/68) from the field and nailed 9 of 14 shots from beyond the arc.The Spurs host the Knicks on Saturday night in their final meeting this season. San Antonio opened a four-game homestand Thursday night with a 97-90 victory over the Memphis Grizzlies, who lost to the Spurs for the first time in three games this season.\"Every game down the stretch is about us,\" Leonard said. \"We haven't been worried about another team. We're just focusing on ourselves and what we have to do.\"LaMarcus Aldridge led the Silver and Black in scoring Thursday night for the second game in a row, finishing with 23 points on 10-of-16 shooting. He also had a team-high eight rebounds and three blocks.Aldridge has averaged 21.4 points and 7.4 rebounds in five games since returning to the lineup after being diagnosed with a minor heart arrhythmia two weeks ago. He missed two games before being medically cleared to resume playing.While Aldridge has said he's \"just playing basketball,\" there's been a noticeable uptick in his game since he returned from his health scare. He appears more relaxed and is shooting with more confidence.Aldridge has hit 50.5 percent (48/95) of his attempts from the field, compared to 47.7 for the season. Aldridge's scoring during the five-game span is also up from what he's averaging for the season (17.6).\"I love playing with him,\" point guard Tony Parker said after Thursday night's game. \"We're getting along well and I know where he likes to get his shots. Lately, he's been getting in good rhythm. He's been playing well.\"While Aldridge is finding his groove, Kawhi Leonard has scored fewer than 20 points in two of his last three games. The Spurs' leading scorer with a 25.9 average, Leonard scored a season-low 12 points in a 118-102 home win over Sacramento last Sunday and finished with 19 against Memphis.If the playoffs started Saturday, the second-seeded Spurs would play the seventh-seeded Grizzlies in the first round.Memphis hounded Leonard with its physical, trapping defense, double-teaming him on pick-and-roll plays and making him labor to get to the basket. The Grizzlies got so physical at one point that Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, protesting a non-call vehemently, was whistled for a technical foul with 16.9 seconds left in the first half.Leonard slipped through to score some key baskets, but not as consistently as he's done throughout the season.Still, Leonard managed to make plays. One of his biggest came when he drove into the paint and fired a pass to a wide-open Parker, who buried a three-pointer from the corner to give the Spurs a 95-87 lead with 26.5 seconds left.\"He made a great pass to Tony to hit that corner three,\" veteran center Pau Gasol said. \"They collapsed the paint, so they force you to make that extra pass.\"Leonard smiled when a reporter asked him if Memphis' defense is the toughest he's faced this season.\"The last few games has been double teams,\" Leonard said. \"Nobody will let me play one on one anymore. When I come off the pick-and-roll, they're sending two bodies at me. But it's good for the team that we're seeing this early instead of being hit in the playoffs. Just got to be patient and confident in my teammates that they'll knock down the shots. It'll ease up everything for me.\"Does Leonard think that's how opponents will defend against him in the playoffs?\"For sure,\" he said. \"Like I said, I feel like nobody is going to let me play one on one or come off a screen and see open space.\"Leonard said that the key to having some success against a swarming, physical defense is to be aggressive\"These games in the playoffs, I'm not going to be able to have a rhythm or just win a game by myself,\" he said. \"I don't think that's best for our team. I think we have to move the ball and don't be stagnant and just let me score. I think everybody has to be involved for us to be at our peak level.\"The way to counter teams that double Leonard is for the rest of the Spurs to make shots, Parker said.\"Hopefully they change strategy and come back to one-on--one defense, and Kawhi can take his advantage again,\" Parker said. What tips would Parker give Leonard?\"Be patient and trust your teammates,\" Parker said. \"That's all you can do. Make the right play. They're going to double-team. Basically, he did his job and then it's up to the other guys to make shots.\" Next game for the Spurs after Saturday night:  vs. Cleveland Cavaliers, 7 p.m., Monday, AT&T Center.",
