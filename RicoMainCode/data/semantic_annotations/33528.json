On the right, on the pipe, you will notice an upgrade crate, next to the wall. Climb up the wall. At the edge, you will notice a guard. Take him out silently, using the web. To proceed, you need to stop the fan. You can do that by using the Web-Shoot several times. The second upgrade crate is to the left of the hole in the middle. You can collect another crate, after you climb down the hole at the wall, at the end of the corridor. In the next room, eliminate five opponents, while moving along the pipe, for the whole time. First, get towards the windows and wait for the guard to walk over to the right. Then, pull him up with the web. Than, deal with the one in the doorway.",
