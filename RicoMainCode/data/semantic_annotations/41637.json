Sometimes they make strange noises and movements. Don’t worry, most of these are normal.\n\nHere are some sounds that may come from your baby:\n\nCrying. This is how newborns communicate. Cries can mean, \"I'm hungry,\" \"I have a wet diaper,\" \"I am tired,\" or \"I want to be held.\" You'll learn your baby's cries and how to respond to them.\nBabies burp from swallowing air during feedings. They also hiccup, sneeze, grunt, and squeak.\nNewborns can pause between breaths. Short pauses are OK.\n\nSome of these movements are also normal:\n\nThey curl up, just like they did in the womb.\nThey throw out their arms and legs in a startle reflex.\nThey curl their toes when you tickle the bottom of their foot, or grab onto your finger.\n\nYour Baby's Development This Week \n\nMost new moms stay in the hospital for a few days after delivery. Use this time to recover and rest; you’ll be very busy when you go home! The pediatrician will look at your baby here to make sure she’s healthy. Ask in the hospital if you have or see any concerns before leaving for home.\n\nWhat to watch for when you bring your baby home:\n\nNewborns should eat eight to 12 times a day.\nEven big eaters can lose up to one-tenth of their birth weight during their first five days of life. Don’t worry, they'll gain it back by day 10. Babies that fall asleep or turn away from the bottle or breast while they feed could experience even greater weight loss. If this starts to happen before you baby is back up to birth weight, discuss it with your pediatrician. Once babies have gained back their weight, falling asleep or turning away usually means they are full.\nYou should be changing at least four wet diapers a day, and one or more poopy diapers.\nYour baby’s poop is a mustard-colored mush if you breastfeed. Formula-fed poop is yellow or tan. It may also look seedy.\nNewborns sleep for 16 to 17 hours each day, but usually not for more than an hour or two at a stretch.\n",
