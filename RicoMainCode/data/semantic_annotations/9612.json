          "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) - U.S. forces in Afghanistan on Thursday struck an Islamic State tunnel complex in eastern Afghanistan with \"the mother of all bombs,\" the largest non-nuclear weapon ever used in combat by the U.S. military, Pentagon officials said. The bomb, known officially as a GBU-43B, or massive ordnance air blast weapon, unleashes 11 tons of explosives. When it was developed in the early 2000s, the Pentagon did a formal review of legal justification for its combat use. The Pentagon said it had no early estimate of deaths or damage caused by its attack, which President Donald Trump called a \"very, very successful mission.\" The U.S. military headquarters in Kabul said in a statement that the bomb was dropped at 7:32 p.m. local time Thursday on a tunnel complex in Achin district of Nangarhar province, where the Afghan affiliate of the Islamic State group has been operating. The target was close to the Pakistani border. The U.S. estimates 600 to 800 IS fighters are present in Afghanistan, mostly in Nangarhar. The U.S. has concentrated heavily on combatting them while also supporting Afghan forces battling the Taliban. Just last week a U.S. Army Special Forces soldier, Staff Sgt. Mark R. De Alencar, 37, of Edgewood, Maryland, was killed in action in Nangarhar. The MOAB is a custom-made Air Force weapon that has been in the arsenal for more than a decade but never used on the battlefield, although it was available throughout the Iraq war. It is designed to hit softer targets such as surface facilities, tunnel entrances and troop concentrations. It is pushed out the rear of the launching aircraft, guided to its target by GPS and slowed by a parachute. A separate non-nuclear weapon known as the Massive Ordnance Penetrator, or MOP, which is larger in its physical dimensions but carries a smaller load of conventional explosives, is designed to take out deeply buried targets like reinforced bunkers. The MOP has never been used in combat. In its 2003 review of the legality of using the MOAB, the Pentagon concluded that it could not be called an indiscriminate killer under the Law of Armed Conflict. \"Although the MOAB weapon leaves a large footprint, it is discriminate and requires a deliberate launching toward the target,\" the review said. It added: \"It is expected that the weapon will have a substantial psychological effect on those who witness its use.\" Adam Stump, a Pentagon spokesman, said the bomb was dropped from a U.S. MC-130 special operations transport. He said the bomb had been brought to Afghanistan \"some time ago\" for potential use. Army Gen. John W. Nicholson, commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, said in a written statement that the strike was designed to minimize the risk to Afghan and U.S. forces conducting clearing operations in the Achin area \"while maximizing the destruction\" of IS fighters and facilities. He said IS has been using improvised explosive devices, bunkers and tunnels to strengthen its defenses. \"This is the right munition to reduce these obstacles and maintain the momentum of our offensive against ISIS-K,\" he added, using the U.S. military's acronym for the IS affiliate. Ismail Shinwari, the governor of Achin district, said the U.S. attack was carried out in a remote mountainous area with no civilian homes nearby and that there had been no reports of injured civilians. He said there has been heavy fighting in the area in recent weeks between Afghan forces and IS militants. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said IS fighters had used the tunnels and caves in Achin to maneuver freely. \"The United States takes the fight against ISIS very seriously and in order to defeat the group we must deny them operational space, which we did,\" Spicer said.",

          "text": "CHICAGO (AP) – The passenger dragged from a United flight lost two front teeth and suffered a broken nose and a concussion, one of his lawyers said Thursday, accusing the airline industry of having \"bullied\" its customers for far too long. \"Are we going to continue to be treated like cattle?\" attorney Thomas Demetrio asked. The passenger, Dr. David Dao, has been released from a hospital but will need reconstructive surgery, Demetrio said at a news conference, appearing alongside one of Dao's children. Dao was not there. The 69-year-old physician from Elizabethtown, Kentucky, was forcibly removed by police from a plane Sunday at Chicago's O'Hare Airport after refusing to give up his seat on the full flight to make room for four airline employees. Cellphone video of him being pulled down the aisle by his arms and footage of his bloody face have created a public-relations nightmare for United. One of Dao's five children, Crystal Pepper, said the family was \"horrified, shocked and sickened\" by what happened. She said it was made worse by the fact that it was caught on video. Demetrio, who indicated Dao is going to sue, said the industry has long \"bullied\" passengers by overbooking flights and then bumping people, and \"it took something like this to get a conversation going.\" \"I hope he becomes a poster child for all of us. Someone's got to,\" the lawyer said. Early on, United CEO Oscar Munoz added to the furor when he apologized for the incident but accused Dao of being belligerent. Later, Munoz offered a more emphatic mea culpa, saying, \"No one should ever be mistreated this way.\" He promised to review the airline's policies to make sure something like that never happens again, and said United will no longer use police to remove bumped passengers. The airline also said all passengers on the flight would get a refund. In a statement issued immediately after Thursday's news conference, United insisted that Munoz and the airline called Dao numerous times to apologize. Munoz himself said on Wednesday that he had left a message for Dao. But Demetrio said neither Dao nor his family had heard from United. Demetrio said that his client accepts United's apology, but that the airline seemed to have issued it because it was taking a PR \"beating.\" The attorney was unable to say precisely how Dao was injured. Dao didn't remember exactly what occurred because of the concussion he suffered, Demetrio said. Demetrio said he doesn't believe Dao's race – Dao came to the U.S. from Vietnam in 1975 during the fall of Saigon – played a role in what happened. Pepper said her father and mother had been traveling from California to Louisville, Kentucky, and had caught a connecting flight at O'Hare. After what happened, Dao \"has no interest in ever seeing an airplane\" and will probably be driven to Kentucky, Demetrio said. United had selected Dao and three other passengers at random for removal from the plane after unsuccessfully offering $800 in travel vouchers and a hotel stay to customers willing to give up their seats. The three Chicago Aviation Department police officers involved have been suspended. The furor could threaten the future of the police force that guards Chicago's two main airports. Chicago's City Council scheduled a hearing Thursday to question United and the Aviation Department about the episode. Chicago's roughly 300 aviation officers are not part of the city's regular police force, receive less training and cannot carry guns inside the airports. The video-recorded confrontation \"really has put it at risk,\" Alderman Chris Taliaferro said of the police agency Wednesday. At the top of the list of the City Council's questions is whether the officers even had the legal authority to board the plane, said Alderman Michael Zalewski, who leads the council's aviation committee. An Aviation Department spokeswoman did not immediately respond to questions about the duties of the police force.",
