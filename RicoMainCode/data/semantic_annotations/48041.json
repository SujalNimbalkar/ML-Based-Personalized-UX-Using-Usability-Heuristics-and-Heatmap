Yeah, worried about my grandkids up here.\"  Kondroski says she called police but wished the response time had been faster. The other woman we talked to said she also called police and talked to an operator. According to her, \"She said 'They're coming, ma'am, they're coming.' I said, 'Well, I have small children and this guy pulled a gun out and went toward that crowd.'  I said, 'It's scary.' \"   A Mobile police spokesperson says neighbors did tell them they saw a gun. Donald Wallace says \"The officers were doing the shift change at that particular time. Upon receiving the call and being dispatched to the location, officers did immediately go to the area.  We had a total number of four officers respond to that particular call.  As I said earlier, there was no one at the location at that particular time and the officers cleared from the location.\"  Kondroski and other neighbors say they hope there will be more police patrols in the area. ",
