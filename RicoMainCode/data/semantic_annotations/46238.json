The process of reproducing great art must be handled only by experienced and expert artists who can jot down entire paintings of your choice in a superior quality oil painting form on a bare museum grade canvas. Paintings on canvas are stretched to fit across wooden frames. A gesso ground layer is applied to remove any acidic properties of the oil paints used. Next thing is to apply the pigments and mix it up with the oils like linseed, walnut, safflower, poppy seed and many more. The different ratios between oils and pigments generate lots of different effects on the canvas.",
