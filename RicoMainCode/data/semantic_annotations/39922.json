Prices start at three replays for $0.99. This feature is in beta stage and it might soon available across the globe. To Use Replay Press and hold on a Snap youâ€™ve just viewed to use your one free daily Replay. Then tap the Snap to view it again! You must view your Replay before leaving the app. If your friend replays your Snap, you will see next to their name on your recently viewed screen. Snapchat seems to always gamify its app by adding some features like Snapchat Scores, emoji base scores and now Trophies. Snapchat never provide a complete explanation about these which makes these scores a mystery. To see which trophies you have earned, follow these steps:  Tap the ghosticon on the Camera screen. ",
