You may not copy (except as expressly permitted by this license and the Usage Rules), decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, modify, or create derivative works of the Licensed Application, any updates, or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent any foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable law or to the extent as may be permitted by the licensing terms governing use of any open sourced components included with the Licensed Application). Any attempt to do so is a violation of the rights of Odosoft and its licensors. If You breach this restriction, You may be subject to prosecution and damages. The terms of the license will govern any upgrades provided by Odosoft that replace and/or supplement the original Product, unless such upgrade is accompanied by a separate license in which case the terms of that license will govern.\r\n\r\nConsent to Use of Data \r\n\r\nYou agree that Odosoft may collect and use technical data and related information, including but not limited to technical information about Your device, system and application software, and peripherals, that is gathered periodically to facilitate the provision of software updates, product support and other services to You (if any) related to the Licensed Application. Odosoft may use this information, as long as it is in a form that does not personally identify You, to improve its products or to provide services or technologies to You.\r\n\r\nTermination \r\n\r\nThe license is effective until terminated by You or Odosoft. Your rights under this license will terminate automatically without notice from Odosoft if You fail to comply with any term(s) of this license.

Before executing any securities transaction based upon information obtained through the Services, You should consult with a financial professional.

Odosoft makes no representation that such Services and Materials are appropriate or available for use in any particular location. To the extent You choose to access such Services or Materials, You do so at Your own initiative and are responsible for compliance with any applicable laws, including but not limited to applicable local laws.

In no event will Odosoft be liable for the removal of or disabling of access to any such Services. Odosoft may also impose limits on the use of or access to certain Services, in any case and without notice or liability.\r\n\r\nNo Warranty \r\n\r\nYou expressly acknowledge and agree that use of the Licensed Application is at your sole risk and that the entire risk as to satisfactory quality, performance, accuracy and effort is with you. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the licensed application and any services performed or provided by the licensed application (\"services\") are provided \"as is\" and \"as available,\" with all faults and without warranty of any kind, and Odosoft hereby disclaims all warranties and conditions with respect to the licensed application and any services, either express, implied or statutory, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties and/or conditions of merchantability, of satisfactory quality, of fitness for a particular purpose, of accuracy, of quiet enjoyment, and non-infringement of third party rights. Odosoft does not warrant against interference with your enjoyment of the licensed application, that the functions contained in, or services performed or provided by, the licensed application will meet your requirements, that the operation of the licensed application or services will be uninterrupted or error-free, or that effects in the licensed application or services will be corrected. No oral or written information or advice given by Odosoft or its authorized representative shall create a warranty. Should the licensed application or services prove defective, you assume the entire cost of all necessary servicing, repair or correction. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitations on applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so the above exclusion and limitations may not apply to you.\r\n\r\nThe Licensed Application is intended to be used for entertainment purposes only. The Licensed Application doesn't provide any medical advice, but only gathers the information and Material You want to file there. The content of the Licensed Application is for educational or statistical purposes only and is not intended to replace personal consultation with a qualified physician or other healthcare professional. Always seek the advice of your physician or other qualified healthcare professional with any question you may have regarding a medical condition or drug. You should never disregard medical advice or delay in seeking it because of the Licensed Application. Odosoft does not provide health care services and therefore cannot guarantee any results or outcomes. Odosoft does not recommend self-management of health problems, nor does it promote any particular form of medical treatment.\r\n\r\nIf the healthcare professionals consult you later on in connection and based on the Material gathered in the Licensed Application, You and the healthcare professionals shall have a direct relationship thereupon. Odosoft is not in any way liable on such actions and is not acting anyhow thereupon as a healthcare professional, but only is providing the Licensed Application to gather the Material you desire to collect there. Licensed Application analyzes with mathematical algorithms voice audio received from home fetal Doppler monitors and/or mobile device microphones. Odosoft is not in any way liable on correctness of voice audio that the Licensed Application receives from home fetal Doppler monitors and/or mobile device microphones. Thus Odosoft cannot guarantee the correctness of any results or outcomes, like e.g. fetal heart rate or fetal heart rate graphs, from analysing the voice audio.\r\n\r\nLimitation of Liability \r\n\r\nTo the extent not prohibited by law, in no event shall Odosoft be liable for personal injury, or any incidental, special, indirect or consequential damages whatsoever, including, without limitation, damages for loss of profits, loss of data, business interruption or any other commercial damages or losses, arising out of or related to your use or inability to use the licensed application, however caused, regardless of the theory of liability (contract, tort or otherwise) and even if Odosoft has been advised of the possibility of such damages. Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation of liabilty for personal injury, or of incidental or consequential damages, so this limitation may not apply to you.\r\n\r\nIn no event shall Odosoft's total liability to you for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law in cases involving personal injury) exceed the amount of fifty dollars (USD50.00). The foregoing limitations will apply even if the above stated remedy fails of its essential purpose.\r\n\r\nPaying via PayPal \r\n\r\nOdosoft accepts payment via PayPal on its online shop integrated on the Licensed Application. You must have a PayPal account or a major credit card to make Your online purchase. When You select to continue to PayPal to make payment, the transaction is re-directed to PayPal Android SDK. Your financial information is not shared with Odosoft. Once directed to PayPal Android SDK, PayPal is charged with protecting Your personal and financial information.
