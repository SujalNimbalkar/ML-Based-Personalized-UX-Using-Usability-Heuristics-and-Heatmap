      "text": "Q: What is Earthquake Network?\nA: Earthquake Network is the first Android application to detect earthquakes through a global network of smartphone and pad.\n\nQ: How does it work?\nA: When the device detects the waves of a quake, the event is notified to a server along with your geographic position. The server decides whether a quake is happening and in case of a quake all the users with the app are notified in real time.\n\nQ: Why it is useful?\nA: If you live not too close to the epicenter of the quake, you can be notified by the app before the quake waves reach you.\n\nQ: Which quakes can the app detect?\nA: Usually strong quakes with magnitude above 5 that can cause damages.\n\nQ: All quakes are detected?\nA: Quakes are detected only if the area of the quake is covered by a network of smartphones with the app installed.\n\nQ: What happens if the smartphones of Earthquake Network detect a quake?\nA: You will receive a real-time notification of the quake. The notification will have a white star as icon and you will be able to see on map the location of the quake.\n\nQ: How do I use the app?\nA: Start the application and use your device as always. The application works as a seismometer only when the device is charging and the screen is off.\n\nQ: Does the app drain my battery?\nA: No. The accelerometer sensor only runs when the device is charging.\n\nQ: Can I manually report a quake?\nA: Yes from the page \"Reports\" and following instructions. Users will receive real time notifications of manually reported quakes.\n\nQ: Where can I see reports from the other users?\nA: Click on the map from the page \"Reports\". Star icons on map show the reports of the last 24h. Green star: mild intensity; yellow star: strong intensity; red star: very strong intensity; black star: quake declared as false by the other users.\n\nQ: I just reported a quake but it is not on map, why?\nA: Reports are shown only if the quake is reported by different users to avoid false alarm.\n\nQ: What the page \"Seismic Networks\" is all about?\nA: The page shows the list of quakes detected by national and global official seismic networks.\n\nQ: What happens if a network detects a quake?\nA: You will receive a notification of the quake. The notification will have an icon with the letter \"A\" in the middle and with a different shape depending on the network. The colour of the icon represents the quake magnitude. Green: from M2.0 to M3.5; yellow: from M3.5 to M4.5; red: from M4.5 to M5.5; purple: above M5.5.\n\nQ: How can I limit the number of notifications from global networks?\nA: From the options page. You can choose the minimum magnitude, the distance of the quake and the global networks you want to receive notifications from.\n\nQ: Does the app collect personal information?\nA: No. Only the geographic position is anonymously collected and it is deleted from the server after 10 minutes if no earthquakes are detected.\n\nQ: Why should I keep Earthquake Network on my device?\nA: Because the app can be useful to detect earthquakes only if it is installed on a large number of devices and it is free. Thanks for your cooperation!\n\nQ: Why this app has advertising?\nA: In order to pay the server and the annual fee of the database service. Click the banner if you want to close the adv.\n\nQ: What is the section \"Network map\" in the main page?\nA: The section gives access to the real time map of the devices of the Earthquake network. The green devices are ready to detect earthquakes. The red devices cannot detect earthquakes at the moment.\n\nQ: What is section \"Seismometer status\" in the main page?\nA: It is the page where you can see if your device is suitable to be a seismometer. Click the green and red lights for more details.\n\nQ: Why my device does not appear on the map?\nA: You have to enable the location services. Use the button in the options menu.\n\nQ: How can I be part of this project or support it?\nA: Contact the author at finazzif@gmail.com \n\n",
