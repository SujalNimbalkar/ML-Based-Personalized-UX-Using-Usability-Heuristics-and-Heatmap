An average baby triples her birth weight by the age of one year and the weight gain is the fastest between six to nine months of age when your little one begins taking solid foods in her diet.\n\nAs long as your baby takes nutritious meals, weight gain is not an issue of concern and should be taken as a positive sign of your child's growth.\n\nBefore making any considerations about your child's weight, it is important that you consult with a doctor for the right advice. If the doctor says that your little one is putting on weight too fast or is overweight,adjust her diet and activity levels by planning out your baby's daily routine and eating schedule.\n\nDo not worry much, weight gain in children is not as serious issue as in adults and can be dealt with very easily. \n\nMost parents believe that a fat baby is a healthy and growing baby because of which they feed their children with a variety of fat-rich food items like ghee and butter.\n\nHowever, the reality is that excessive consumption of these foods at this age only leads to health complications like obesity and heart diseases.\n\nIt is important that you inculcate good eating habits in your little one from the beginning so that they benefit her in the future as well.\n\n\n\nLet us know your thoughts in the comments section below.Click here to update the app and see what moms are talking about.",

A child needs a range of vitamins to grow healthy and it is best if you make sure that they reach to her through the meals itself.\n\nYou can look for other sources of vitamins as well for your little one. One such source is sunlight whose UV-B rays facilitate the formation of vitamin-D in the skin.\n\nGiven below are some possibilities when the paediatrician may ask you to start giving vitamin supplements to your little one.\n\n1. Many doctors prescribe vitamin-D drops for breastfed and formula milk fed babies. Vitamin-D improves digestion, helps absorb calcium and has a regulatory role in the body.\n\n2. A vitamin supplement is advised by doctor even if your little one is taking a balanced diet as a useful insurance that can be used if her eating habits change.\n\n3. If your toddler is taking breast milk, cow's milk or formula milk, she may not need supplements for any vitamins other than vitamin-D.\n\n4. Your doctor may also ask you to give vitamin supplements to your little one if she is going through a fussy-eating phase and does not eat much.\n\n5. Vitamin-A is another important substance for your little one as it helps improve vision in dim light and maintain a healthy skin. In vegetables, there are limited sources of vitamin-A and hence your doctor may prescribe vitamin-A supplements if your child is a vegetarian.\n\nVitamins and minerals play a very critical role in improving the immune system and keeping the body healthy. Thus, it is important that the right amount of these elements is present in your little one's diet.\n\nLet us know your thoughts in the comments section below.Click here to update the app and see what moms are talking about.",

      "text": "1. Children Become Hitters Themselves \n\nHitting children teaches them to become hitters themselves. Virtually all of the most dangerous criminals were regularly threatened and punished in childhood. It is nature's plan that children learn attitudes and behaviors through observation and imitation of their parents' actions, for good or ill. \n\n2. Important Needs Are Neglected\n\nIn many cases of so-called \"bad behavior\", the child is simply responding in the only way he can, given his age and experience, to neglect of basic needs. Among these needs are: proper sleep and nutrition, treatment of hidden allergy, fresh air, exercise, and sufficient freedom to explore the world around him.\n\nBut his greatest need is for his parents' undivided attention. In these busy times, few children receive sufficient time and attention from their parents, who are often too distracted by their own problems and worries to treat their children with patience and empathy.\n\nIt is surely wrong and unfair to punish a child for responding in a natural way to having important needs neglected. For this reason, punishment is not only ineffective in the long run, it is also clearly unjust. \n\n3. Children Get Distracted from Learning \n\nPunishment distracts the child from learning how to resolve conflict in an effective and humane way. \"When we make a child afraid, we stop learning dead in its tracks.\"\n\nA punished child becomes preoccupied with feelings of anger and fantasies of revenge and is thus deprived of the opportunity to learn more effective methods of solving the problem at hand. Thus, a punished child learns little about how to handle or prevent similar situations in the future.  \n\n4. Children Deserve Love \n\n\"Spare the rod and spoil the child\". While the \"rod\" is mentioned many times in the Bible, it is only in the Book of Proverbs that this word is used in connection with parenting.\n\nIn the Bible there is no support for harsh discipline outside of Solomon's Proverbs.Gospels, the most important books in the Bible for Christians, contain the teachings of Jesus Christ, who urged mercy, forgiveness, humility, and non-violence. Jesus saw children as being close to God, and urged love, never punishment.  \n\n5. Parent-Child Bond Gets Affected\n\nPunishment interferes with the bond between parent and child, as it is not human nature to feel loving toward someone who hurts us. The true spirit of cooperation which every parent desires can arise only through a strong bond based on mutual feelings of love and respect.\n\nPunishment, even when it appears to work, can produce only superficially good behaviour based on fear, which can only take place until the child is old enough to resist.\n\nIn contrast, cooperation based on respect will last permanently, bringing many years of mutual happiness as the child and parent grow older.\n\nApart from all the above mentions reason for not hitting a child, it is also very important to keep in mind that when you hit your child you can unintentionally impair him or her physically. A child is like a flower, so think twice before hitting him or her.\n\nSource : Indiaparenting\n\nLet us know your thoughts in the comments section below.Click here to update the app and see what moms are talking about.",
