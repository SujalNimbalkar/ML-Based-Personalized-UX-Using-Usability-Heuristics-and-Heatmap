Snapchat is about continuously giving your friends and followers something to look at, and when content disappears from your story every 24 hours, this requires constant attention.  Aim for 5-15 snaps per day, a combination of video and stills, to go up on your Snapchat story.     Don’t overthink it.  The brilliance of Snapchat is its natural talent for telling the raw, (virtually) unedited story.  Put yourself in your potential followers or customers’ shoes; what might make them smile to see?  What gives them more insight into your daily operations than your public-facing website allows.  Snap that stuff, often!     Take advantage of location filters and drawing tools to give yourself an aire of effort and expertise, and to also spice up content to make it more comical or interesting.     Use existing channels to build a following. ",
