You need to climb onto each one of them. The next crate is lying on the rooftop of the building opposite the tower. Once you turn, you will notice another upgrade crate, next to the previous one, on the same rooftop. And there is one crate more, on the rooftop, under the last dish on the left. from now on, you will be able to conduct interrogations concerning street crimes. They are available only for some time but, there will be still appearing new ones. They are not considered additional missions but, they constitute the opportunity to gain more experience points, as well as they diversify the game. They consist in obstructing criminals from doing their job.",
