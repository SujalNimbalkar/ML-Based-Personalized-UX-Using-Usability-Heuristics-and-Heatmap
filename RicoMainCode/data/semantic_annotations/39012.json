To get more, you’ll need to come back later. We don’t have an exact amount of time, but you should be able to return to a PokeStop at least 10-15 minutes later, based on our experience with the game. Pokeballs are essential to Pokemon GO players. Trainers can get Pokeballs at PokeStops. Stock up on Pokeballs to catch all the Pokemons that you come across with. Pokeballs are also obtained whenever players level up and when gamers reach higher levels, Great Balls and Ultra Balls are obtained to catch more powerful Pokemons. However, the easiest way to gain Pokeballs is to buy them in Pokemon GO store.Some trainers probably did not know but they can pick up the Pokeballs that missed the target.

What’s next? How do you find battles that you can actually win? It turns out that you can do it randomly. Just pick the closest gym you can find and head into the battle. But before you do that, check out this following trick that will let you win regardless of your opposition.the trick isn’t a cheat. Instead, it’s a way of taking advantage of what happens on the screen during the battle. All you need to do is apply a particular strategy and stick to it until the Pokemon you’re facing dies.Here goes: look out for a yellow flash of your opponent, and then immediately dodge the impending attack. After that, land an attack of your own, or maybe two if you’re lucky. Simply rinse and repeat, and you’ll be able to emerge victorious in any battle — even if the Pokemon you’re facing has a lot more life than your minions.The trick here is acting fast to dodge an imminent attack. That means the strategy will not work if you have network connection problems, or if your phone is an older model that’s doesn’t run the game smoothly. Any lag whatsoever might get in the way of this winning strategy.",

          "text": "At first, Pokémon GO seems like it’s simplified the capture system to the point of stupidity, as you just lob Pokéballs at the faces of wild Pokémon until they relent. But, once you start seeing 100+ CP Pokémon in the wild, they will start breaking out. And ones that are 300+? They will prove mighty difficult to catch unless you understand that there are a few finer points to the system. First, there’s an entire aspect to capturing most people will miss. If you press and hold the Pokéball, a ring around the Pokémon will start shrinking. When it reaches its smallest circumference, that’s when you should throw, as they are the easiest to capture at that point. Also, the color of the circle matters. Green shouldn’t be a problem, yellow will be tougher, red will be very hard. You eventually get treats you can lob at Pokémon to reduce this level, and make capturing easier. Combine these two tactics, and you should have a better shot at capturing stuff, and later you will unlock more secure types of Pokéballs as well. Oh, and one more thing. Turning off AR is probably the best way to help capture Pokémon, because as fun as it is to see them in the real world, turning off the camera will stabilize them in the center of your screen and make them much, much easier to hit. I still do not know exactly what makes Pokémon flee. Sometimes it seems like they get bored after too many breakouts, other times they flee immediately,so it’s not quite clear how this system works.Alright, further clarification about the rings. Ideally, you want to get it in the ring, no matter which size. I think the smaller the ring is, the higher the chance you’ll catch the Pokémon if your throw lands inside the inner ring. But waiting until the ring is large enough to be a bigger target also seems to help, but not as much. So for instance, hitting inside a big ring might get you a “nice!” while a small ring is an “excellent!” and probably the most likely to catch something high level. But if you hit in between the outer stationary ring and the inner expanding/shrinking ring, that’s when higher level stuff is almost guaranteed to escape. I’ve found going for medium size rings that are still relatively easy to hit is your best bet.",

          "text": "It’s actually relatively easy to level up fast in Pokémon Go, although it isn’t totally intuitive at first. But this is entirely above board, and especially if you’re low-level, it’ll pump you up very quickly. Beyond level 15 or so, it’ll slow down, but this is still the fastest way to get experience when you’re starting out.Here’s the gist of it: You’re going to use Lucky Eggs to double your experience while you camp near a PokéStop with a Lure module on it. At the same time, you’re going to use Incense. Most importantly of all, you’ll evolve all your Pokémon while the Lucky Egg is active.Here’s why it works: It’s a little something called synergy. The Lucky Egg doubles your experience for everything you do for half an hour. The biggest single sources of experience are catching new Pokémon and evolving Pokémon, new or not. Placing a Lure on a Pokéstop attracts Pokémon to it and using Incense attracts Pokémon to you. With a Lucky Egg active, every Pokémon you find will net you 200 experience instead of the usual 100. Every new Pokémon will get you an extra 1,000 experience.But the real juice, the best way to power level, comes from evolving Pokémon. That’s because evolving Pokémon always gives you at least 500 experience. It tacks on another 500 if you evolve a new Pokémon . With a Lucky Egg, that’s 1,000 experience at minimum, and 2,000 for new Pokémon. And this trick is the biggest reason to catch easy Pokémon you already have. You only need 12 Pidgey Candies to evolve a Pidgey—that’s four Pidgeys worth. Same for Weedles and Caterpies. A few other Pokémon only take 25 Candies. So catch as many of these low-level duplicates as you can. Release extras for additional Candies. Then go to your neighborhood bar or coffee shop that has a Pokéstop nearby, drop a Lure module and an Incense, pop a Lucky Egg, and evolve all your Pokémon (if you can time it so you hatch an Egg while the Lucky Egg is active, so much the better—but that’s a lot harder). You’ll quickly get thousands of experience more than you would have otherwise. You’ll level up fast and you’ll catch lots of Pokémon along the way.",

Then you leave them at the vacant Gyms that litter your city or town. Depending on which team you’ve joined, you may find that those Gyms allow you to train and leave your own creatures there.\n\nBattle with Gyms of opposing teams to earn XP that goes straight to your Trainer’s level too. To clear out a Gym, you’ll need decent enough creatures that can stand up to what has been left at that particular Gym.It honestly is starting to seem like almost everyone is playing Pokemon Go right now, even those that have not touched the series in years. Capturing all the Pokemon you can is obviously a key part of that, but the ability to take on gyms and become gym leaders yourself helps a lot too, which we are going to tell you just how to do.\n\nWe’ve already told you about the PokeStop locations on the map, but there are also much larger icons on the map that you likely will see at some point soon in your journey, which are gyms.\n\nFirst of all, you must reach level 5 to do anything gym related, so that is your first goal. After you have reached level 5, get ready to take over a gym.\n\nIf you happen to come across a grey gym with no other colors, this means it is essentially an undiscovered gym that no one has taken up at. If this is the case, you can place any of your Pokemon here, which won’t be returned to your team until they’re defeated by another.\n\nAt this point, you can actually battle the Pokemon yourself to level up the prestige of that gym by winning, which can also be achieved by defeating other challengers. If you take over a gym, it will turn into one of the three color teams you can choose from with Yellow (Instinct), Mystic (Blue), and Valor (Red), which is what you need to watch out for.\n\nNow, if you see a gym on the map nearby that already has one of these three colors, you have a couple options. If you want to be gym leader of a gym that is your same color, you can go and challenge the current gym leader and trainers there and as long as the prestige is high enough to have more trainers, you can take over at that time.\n\nIf the gym is another color, you will actually have a much deeper Pokemon battle where you can use up to six different Pokemon. Gyms will vary in how many trainers they have beyond the leader, but to conquer the gym, you must defeat every trainer at that gym, plus the leader. By doing this, it will knock the prestige down. However, beating them all will not instantly kick them out, but rather you must keep battling them until their prestige is down to 0. At this point, the gym turns grey and you can take over just like we mentioned above.",
