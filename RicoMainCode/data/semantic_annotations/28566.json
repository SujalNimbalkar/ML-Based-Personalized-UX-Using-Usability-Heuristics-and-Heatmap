Are you well-connected? Are you patient? Are you less patient than others? Are you a leader, or do you feel that you can be a great leader? Do you have a high moral and ethical I.Q? Whatever your strengths are, whenever you think about what kind of businesses are right for you, try to align your strengths so that your unique background can give your venture the most competitive edge.\n\nConversely, try to minimize your weaknesses. For example, if you are not technical, do not rush into businesses that require a lot of technical aptitude and skills. That does not mean you should be discouraged. It just means you should think through it a bit more thoroughly. Additionally, many businesses require substantial upfront capital. If you are not wealthy, and are not able to raise high amounts of capital, those businesses may not be best for you to start with. You can be successful in them eventually, but it may benefit you to consider how you can grow into them out of something that is financially feasible for you to start with. \n\nThe great news is that everyone has strengths, so everyone can find a niche where they can give their business a competitive advantage. If you play to your strengths, you can give yourself a much higher chance to ultimately succeed. We are cheering for you!",
