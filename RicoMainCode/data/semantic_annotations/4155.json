The shootings, homicides, and assaults date back to October of 2015, many of which we've covered on KHOU.  \t DA's Office: HPD mistakes could jeopardize 2 dozen murder cases  A month before that, there was an officer involved shooting on Indiana Street. Police say a 15-year-old suspect ran towards a uniformed officer, pointing a gun at his head. The police sergeant shot the suspect, who survived.In that case, several pieces of evidence were either missing or incorrect in the crime report, according to the HFSC audit.The mistakes were even more glaring in an officer-involved shooting on W. 43rd Street on Jan. 19, 2016. An off-duty Harris County Sheriff's deputy was working security as an extra job. Police say two suspects raised weapons in his direction during an attempted robbery at a gas station, so he opened fire.The audit says McGee's report did not give \"an accurate representation of the scene\". It says the interior of the business was described as having white walls and tiles, but the scene had brown tiled floors and brown walls. The report also had bullet holes noted in incorrect locations.Police says the suspects in that officer involve shooting are still at large. So are the men responsible for the deadly robbery on Sunnyside Street.Now, the concern is that the investigators' mistakes could make it harder to convict these violent criminals if they are ever caught.According to the Harris County District Attorney's Office, McGee was transferred to patrol after the audit. His supervisor, Jeff Cruser, was also reassigned to no longer review cases.",

John McCain, Republican chairman of the Armed Services Committee.A GBU-43 would not only destroy a tunnel complex, it would also have a psychological impact on the militants because of its destructive power. The blast can be heard for miles and is very different from the small munitions the military uses when trying to hit a small target and minimize surrounding damage.\"The United States takes the fight against ISIS very seriously and in order to defeat the group we must deny them operational space, which we did,\" White House spokesman Sean Spicer said.The U.S. military likely chose to use the bomb, which cost about $16 million each, because the tunnel complex was in an open area where there was little danger of civilian casualties.\"This is the right munition to reduce these obstacles and maintain the momentum of our offensive against (the Islamic State),\" Gen. John Nicholson, the commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan said in statement.Fighting between ISIS and Afghan forces in the region has intensified recently. A U.S. Special Forces soldier advising the Afghans was killed in the area Saturday, the first U.S. combat death this year.The bomb explodes in the air, creating air pressure that can collapse tunnels and buildings.\"U.S. forces took every precaution to avoid civilian casualties with this strike,\" the military said in a statement.",

When the guard approached the men, at least one of them opened fire and shot him multiple times.  \t #BREAKING   @galvestonpd  release suspect photo, victim info in shooting at  #SanLuisHotel  Sunday.
