First place is worth $10,000, plus more recognition for the little cake design shop that hopes to continue to grow their business locally. A watch party at Bleachers in Redding drew a capacity crowd, eating Sublime cupcakes and cheering on the episode as it unfolded on the big screens. \"Man, it feels great,\" Saccheri said. \"I've had kids come up to me and, you know, they're looking at me like I'm sort of hero and it's like, I'm just doing my thing, you know. I'm not a hero but they are treating me that way and I feel really happy and really proud to be that for them.\"The episode is expected to be posted in the near future on Food Network's  website.",

She began placing her purchased items into her trunk from her shopping cart, while her purse sat in the cart's child seat.Another woman came up behind her and snatched the purse from the cart, and ran to a waiting silver Honda Accord. The victim ran after the woman who got into the Honda. The victim then jumped in through the open driver's side window of the suspect's getaway vehicle. The victim and the suspect struggled over the purse. The man driving the car began driving out of the parking lot with the suspect and the victim still engaged in a fight, and the victim hanging out of the driver's side window.  The victim was able to shove the vehicle into park, then climbed out with her purse. The getaway vehicle took off and was last seen traveling westbound on Luther Road. Because the man began to drive away with the victim partially inside the car, Red Bluff Police tell us kidnapping charges could be included in this case. The female suspect is described as a white female with blonde hair, around 20-25 years old and with a small stature. The man driving the car is described as a white man, with tattoos covering both arms. Anyone with information about this incident is asked to call the Red Bluff Police Department at 527-3131.",
