(AP) - Tyler Dorsey scored 20 points and made the go-ahead layup with 1:08 left, and third-seeded Oregon ended No. 7 Michigan's dramatic postseason run with a 69-68 victory in a Midwest Regional semifinal on Thursday night.Dorsey, the man the Ducks call \"Mr. March,\" had his sixth straight game scoring 20 or more points.The Wolverines (27-11) had one more chance to extend their run after Dylan Ennis missed a free throw with 15 seconds left. But Derrick Walton, who had carried the Wolverines the last three weeks, was off with his long jumper just before the buzzer.Jordan Bell had a double-double for the Ducks (32-5), with 16 points and 13 rebounds. Pac-12 player of the year Dillon Brooks added 12 points and Dylan Ennis had 10. Photos:  Oregon battles Michigan in Sweet 16  Walton led the Wolverines with 20 points, eight assists and five rebounds. Zak Irvin had 14 of his 19 points in the second half and DJ Wilson had 12 points.Oregon plays Kansas or Purdue on Saturday in the regional final.The Ducks are going to the Elite Eight for the second year in a row, and they made it without big man Chris Boucher, who went out in the Pac-12 Tournament semifinals with a season-ending knee injury. Oregon still had plenty of inside game without Boucher, outscoring the Wolverines 34-16 in the pain and outrebounding them 36-31.Its biggest play in the post came after Walton had made a jumper to give Michigan a 68-65 lead. Ennis got fouled and went to the line for a one-and-one. He missed, and Bell swooped in for the offensive rebound and put it in to make it a one-point game.After Walton missed a layup, Dorsey gave the Ducks the lead.Ennis missed another free throw with 15 seconds left, giving Michigan one more chance. Oregon had fouls to give but failed to get a hand on anyone, allowing Walton to put up one more shot.The teams struggled to find their offensive rhythm early, and Michigan had uncharacteristic problems with turnovers against a Ducks' defense that switched between man-to-man and matchup zone.BIG PICTUREMichigan: The Wolverines got on a roll late in the season, and they became a tournament favorite after their plane skidded off the run way as they attempted to take off for the Big Ten Tournament. They ended up winning four games in four days to claim the conference tournament title and two more in the NCAA Tournament. But they shot just 39.3 percent against the Ducks, and fatigue might have been a factor.Oregon: The Ducks set the school record with their 32nd win and are off to the Elite Eight for the second straight year thanks to a big-time performance from Dorsey.UP NEXTOregon plays Kansas or Purdue in a regional final Saturday.",

So, I just went and got my shoes and coat on and told her we needed to go,\" said Camryn.When Kimberly got to her doctor, they immediately called an ambulance and sent her to the ER. Doctors there found both lungs full of blood clots â€“ pulmonary embolisms.Kimberly was hospitalized for seven days.Doctors told her it's a good thing she listened to her son.\"If I had taken the nap, there's a good chance it would've been a very different outcome,\" she said. \"A sad one.\"Â Â So, where did Camdyn learn what to do?It turns out it was in his 4th grade PE class at Evergreen Elementary in Sedro-Woolley.His teacher, Timathi Fitzpatrick, had suffered an embolism herself and taught her students the signs and severity.\"It's sometimes questionable whether they are paying attention,\" said Fitzpatrick, \"but something stuck with him pretty well!\"But why did Camden, an ordinary kid who likes playing video games with his older brother, Bryson, know to push back so hard against his mother's wishes? He said he isn't really sure, but the answer becomes clear as tears stream down his cheeks when he thinks about what happened.He just loves her so much.\"He is definitely my hero,\" said Kimberly. \"They say your life flashes before your eyes, and it's true. It makes you look at your kids in a whole different way.\"Kimberly is hoping to use her experience to call attention to the   issue of pulmonary embolisms  .Kimberly, a single mom of three, was supposed to be back to work at this point, but her condition is expected to keep her out of work several more weeks. A   GoFundMe account   has been established to help with medical bills.Â ",
