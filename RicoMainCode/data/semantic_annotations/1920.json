Many decorative paint manufactures show a huge range of colors on their charts, which are made by blending the main tints and tones of their collection. It can be very frustrating to be forced into buying gallons of paint when all you need is a sample to test the color. Most paint suppliers will produce small test amounts of a color, especially if it is one of those, which you have requested to be mixed. Virtually all-interior painting jobs today, including walls, ceiling, and woodwork, are done using water-based paint, or oil-based paints.",

Once opened, however, paintâ€™s shelf life is immediately reduced. Color decisions may be affected by the type of paint you have to use, for example, paints that are specifically designed for use on rough exterior walls come in a limited range of shades, while there is a huge variety of colors available for use on interior walls. All paint should be kept in a cool place and out of direct sunlight. The colors with which we surround ourselves will without doubt have an effect on us.",
