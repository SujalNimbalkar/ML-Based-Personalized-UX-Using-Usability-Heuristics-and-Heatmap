          "text": "By JOSEF FEDERMANAssociated Press                   JERUSALEM (AP) - Israeli police on Thursday arrested a 19-year-old hacker who they said was the main suspect in a wave of bomb threats against Jewish community centers in the United States, appearing to crack a case that has sent a chill through the American Jewish community.                   The surprising arrest of the Jewish man, who holds dual Israeli and American citizenship, came after a trans-Atlantic investigation with the FBI and other international law enforcement agencies. U.S. Jewish groups welcomed the breakthrough in the case, which had raised concerns of rising anti-Semitism and drawn condemnation from President Donald Trump.                   Israeli police described the suspect as a hacker, but said his motives were still unclear.                   \"He's the guy who was behind the JCC threats,\" police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said, referring to the scores of anonymous threats phoned in to Jewish community centers in the U.S. over the past two months.                   Police banned publication of his name, but said he was a dual citizen and would remain in custody until at least March 30. During the arrest raid, they said he tried to grab an officer's gun but was stopped by another officer.                   The young man appeared briefly in court in the central Israeli city of Rishon Letzion. He wore khaki pants and a blue sweater that he used to cover his face as he walked past reporters. He made no comment.                   His lawyer, Galit Bash, said her client had a \"very serious medical condition\" that might have affected his behavior. She said the condition had prevented him from attending elementary school, high school or enlisting in the army, which is compulsory for most Jewish men.                   \"That's why the medical condition can actually affect the investigation,\" she said. \"This is one of the things the judge told the police to check, to talk to his doctors, to get more documents and to investigate him according to his medical situation.\"                   Channel 10 TV said the condition was a brain tumor. It also showed images of a large antenna outside the suspect's house in the southern Israeli city of Ashkelon. Police said the suspect's father was also detained, apparently because of the equipment.                   In Washington, the FBI confirmed the arrest of the main suspect.                   U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the Justice Department \"will not tolerate the targeting of any community in the country on the basis of their religious beliefs.\" He called work by the FBI and Israeli police \"outstanding.\"                   Since Jan. 9, there have been more than 150 bomb threats against Jewish community centers and day schools in 37 U.S. states and two Canadian provinces, according to the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish group that battles anti-Semitism.                   The threats led to evacuations, sent a chill through local Jewish communities and raised fears of rising anti-Semitism. Acts of vandalism on Jewish targets, including cemeteries, have added to those concerns.                   As the number of threats grew, Trump was criticized for not speaking out. Then, late last month, he opened a speech to Congress by denouncing anti-Semitism. There was no immediate reaction from the White House to Thursday's arrest.                   The ADL, JCC Association of America and Jewish Federations of North America all welcomed news of the arrest.                   But Jonathan Greenblatt, chief executive of the ADL, said anti-Semitism in the U.S. remains a \"very serious concern.\"                   \"JCCs and other institutions should not relax security measures or become less vigilant,\" he said.                   U.S. authorities have also arrested a former journalist from St. Louis, Juan Thompson, for allegedly threatening Jewish organizations and charged him with one count of cyberstalking.                   But Israeli police described the local man as the primary suspect in the wave of threats.                   Police said he used sophisticated \"camouflage technologies\" to disguise his voice and mask his location. They said a search of the teen's home uncovered antennas and satellite equipment.                   \"In sophisticated cyber activity that I cannot detail, we obtained what we obtained and of course exposed him and his equipment,\" national police chief Roni Alsheich told reporters. \"This does not bring honor to the state of Israel of course. But I think it does bring respect to Israel's police.\"                   Police said the threats had caused panic, \"significant economic damage\" and disrupted public order at locations around the world.                   The man is also suspected of placing threatening phone calls to Australia, New Zealand and within Israel. They also said he had disrupted a Delta Airlines flight at New York's JFK airport in early 2015.                   Harel Menashri, a former cyber expert with Israel's Shin Bet internal security agency, said it was not \"too complicated\" for the suspect to do what he did.                   He said it appeared the suspect had penetrated neighbors' Wi-Fi systems to create multiple computer addresses.                   \"One of the things that helped him evade capture was he apparently took control over additional computers on the way and created a kind of computer chain,\" he said.                   Nimrod Vax, a co-founder of the U.S.-Israeli cybersecurity firm BigID, said catching the suspect was a more complicated task.                   He said authorities would have had to sift through \"billions, if not trillions\" of pieces of data, including phone records, routing logs and IP connections.                   \"It requires a lot of resources,\" he said.                   ___                   Associated Press writers Eric Tucker and Sadie Gurman in Washington and Josh Cornfield in Trenton, New Jersey, contributed to this report.

          "text": "By TODD RICHMONDAssociated Press                   WESTON, Wis. (AP) - Authorities on Thursday identified those killed in a series of northern Wisconsin shootings as two bank workers, a lawyer and a veteran police detective.                   The victims in Wednesday afternoon's attacks at a bank, a law firm and an apartment complex in the Wausau area were Everest Metro police Detective Jason Weiland, Marathon Savings Bank employees Dianne M. Look, 67, and Karen L. Barclay, 62, and attorney Sarah H. Quirt Sann, 43, the state Department of Justice said.                   Officials said Weiland, 40 was among officers who responded to the apartment complex following attacks at the bank in nearby Rothschild and the law firm in Schofield. The suspect was taken into custody after a standoff at the apartment complex in Weston.                   Weiland was a field training officer and member of a task force for internet crimes against children, according to the Everest Police Department's website. His LinkedIn page says he had worked as a narcotics detective for the Marathon County Sheriff's Department, and as a police officer and corrections officer for Marathon City and Marathon County.                   Police characterized the initial shooting at the bank as a \"domestic situation,\" but haven't provided further details about the circumstances surrounding the attacks or identified the suspect. They scheduled a 4 p.m. Thursday briefing.                   The bank shooting was reported around midday. Officers arrived at the bank to find two people were shot and the suspect had fled.                   A second call came about 10 minutes later from Tlusty, Kennedy and Dirks law firm. The action then moved to an apartment complex in Weston.                   Dozens of police vehicles were parked Thursday in front of the apartment complex, which was ringed by yellow crime-scene tape. Officers could be seen walking around with clipboards.                   Jason Smith, a deputy administrator for the state Department of Justice's Division of Criminal Investigation, said more than 100 officers were investigating and that more information would be released Thursday.                   Kelly Hanson, a 21-year-old woman who lives in the complex, told The Associated Press that she looked out of her apartment window at around 1:15 p.m. Wednesday to see a squad car approach, and a few seconds later heard a gunshot and saw an officer fall. She said other officers put the wounded policeman in an armored SWAT vehicle and took him away. She couldn't tell if he was alive or dead and police have not said if this was the officer who died.                   Janet Schoenfeldt, who owns a hair salon behind the bank, said she was at the front desk around 1 p.m. Wednesday when squad cars poured into the parking log, followed by ambulances. An officer then told her to close her shop and get out of the area.                   \"It's a sad reality. Someone taking innocent lives over something he's upset about,\" Schoenfeldt. \"We're a small-knit community. You just don't think it will happen here. Everybody says that, but you know what? It does happen here.\"                   ___                   Associated Press writers Jeff Baenen, Doug Glass and Steve Karnowski in Minneapolis, and Gretchen Ehlke in Milwaukee contributed to this report.

          "text": "By ERICA WERNER and RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVARAssociated Press                   WASHINGTON (AP) - GOP House leaders delayed their planned vote Thursday on a long-promised bill to repeal and replace \"Obamacare,\" in a stinging setback for House Speaker Paul Ryan and President Donald Trump in their first major legislative test.                   The decision came after Trump, who ran as a master dealmaker, failed to reach agreement with a bloc of rebellious conservatives. Moderate-leaning Republican lawmakers were also bailing on the legislation, leaving it short of votes.                   The bill could still come to a vote in coming days, but canceling Thursday's vote was a significant defeat. It came on the seven-year anniversary of President Barack Obama signing the Affordable Care Act, years that Republicans have devoted to promising repeal.                   Those promises helped them keep control of the House and Senate and win the White House, but now, at the moment of truth, they are falling short.                   \"No deal,\" House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows, R-N.C., said after he and his group of more than two dozen rebellious conservatives met with Trump to try to get more concessions to reduce requirements on insurance companies.                   The Republican legislation would halt Obama's tax penalties against people who don't buy coverage and cut the federal-state Medicaid program for low earners, which the Obama statute had expanded. It would provide tax credits to help people pay medical bills, though generally skimpier than Obama's statute provides. It also would allow insurers to charge older Americans more and repeal tax boosts the law imposed on high-income people and health industry companies.                   The measure would also block federal payments to Planned Parenthood for a year, another stumbling block for GOP moderates.                   In a danger sign for Republicans, a Quinnipiac University poll found that people disapprove of the GOP legislation by 56 percent to 17 percent, with 26 percent undecided. Trump's handling of health care was viewed unfavorably by 6 in 10.                   The survey was conducted March 16 to 21 with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.                   GOP leaders had targeted Thursday for the climactic vote, in part because it marks the seventh anniversary of Obama's signing the measure into law. With the House in recess awaiting the outcome of the White House meeting, C-SPAN aired video of that signing ceremony.                   House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., couldn't resist a dig.                   \"You may be a great negotiator,\" she said of Trump. \"Rookie's error for bringing this up on a day when clearly you're not ready.\"                   In a count by The Associated Press, at least 30 Republicans said they opposed the bill, enough to defeat the measure. But the number was in constant flux amid the eleventh-hour lobbying.                   Including vacancies and expected absentees, the bill would be defeated if 23 Republicans join all Democrats in voting \"no.\"                   Obama declared in a statement that \"America is stronger\" because of the current law and Democrats must make sure \"any changes will make our health care system better, not worse for hardworking Americans.\" Trump tweeted to supporters, \"Go with our plan! Call your Rep & let them know.\"                   Tension has been building in advance of the critical vote, and a late-night meeting of moderate-leaning members in Speaker Ryan's office Wednesday broke up without resolution.                   A key moderate who had been in the meeting, Rep. Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania, issued a statement saying he would be voting \"no\" on the health bill. \"I believe this bill, in its current form, will lead to the loss of coverage and make insurance unaffordable for too many Americans,\" said Dent, a leader of the Tuesday Group of moderate-leaning Republicans.                   Congressional leaders have increasingly put the onus on the president to close the deal, seemingly seeking to ensure that he takes ownership of the legislation - and with it, ownership of defeat if that is the outcome.                   Moderates were given pause by projections of 24 million Americans losing coverage in a decade and higher out-of-pocket costs for many low-income and older people, as predicted by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.                   ___                   Associated Press reporters Alan Fram, Kevin Freking, Ken Thomas and Matt Daly contributed to this report.
