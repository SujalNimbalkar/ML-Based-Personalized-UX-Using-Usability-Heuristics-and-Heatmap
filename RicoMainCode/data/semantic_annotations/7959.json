          "text": "\"I think that's under investigation. I don't know a great deal about it. So, I am going to decline to answer,\" Fadden said when asked about the Norman case.\n\nThe silence on the investigation has been unusual, particularly since it involves one of the most senior, sensitive jobs in the Canadian military.\n\nRCMP Commissioner Bob Paulson has refused to comment, but will appear before the Senate security and defence committee on Monday.\n\nPrevious navy leaks\n\nSome of the investigations that may have been ordered on Fadden's watch include inquiries made by the RCMP, during late 2015, into how the media got hold of a federal cabinet decision that temporarily halted plans to lease a new military supply ship. CBC News and The Canadian Press both reported that story.\n\nTwo weeks ago, CBC News reported that the Mounties also probed a 2014 leak about the former Conservative government's decision to sole-source the $800-million purchase of new Sea Sparrow missiles for the frigates. That 2014 story was reported by Postmedia.\n\nThere has been speculation that the investigation into Norman is part of a wider-ranging attempt to plug leaks at the Defence Department.\n\nFadden said that in his experience many large departments have chatty people.\n\n\"I think, in any organization that has more than 50,000 people, it is almost impossible for information to be kept entirely secret,\" he said.\n\n\"So I come back to the point, it depends on what kind of information you're talking about. I really had no worries when I was [national security adviser] or when I was deputy at defence about top secret information, really core information being let out.\"\n\nDifferent levels of secrecy\n\nFadden underlined the distinction between top secret, classified and protected information, the different levels of government secrets.\n\nThose levels were blurred under the former Conservative government and continue to be hazy under the current Liberal administration.\n\nUnder former prime minister Stephen Harper, the definition of what could be considered secret cabinet information was expanded through regulations rewritten by the federal Treasury Board in 2013.\n\nDepartmental lawyers were given wider discretion to decide what constitutes a cabinet secret — known as a \"confidence.\"\n\nThe result has been that data — previously considered innocuous — was labelled a state secret and hidden not only from the public, but from members of Parliament, parliamentary watchdogs and even the information commissioner.\n\nFadden tacitly acknowledged the confusion and said he always looked at the contents of the leak and where it ended up.\n\n\"You go down two or three levels [of classification] and you know, you're starting to deal with the private sector, and it's not always clear what's classified and what isn't.\"\n\n",
