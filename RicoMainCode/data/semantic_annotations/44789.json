          "text": "Sky Map for Android\nVersion 1.9.2\nhttps://github.com/sky-map-team/stardroid\n\nIntroduction and Quick Start\nSky Map turns your Android-powered mobile phone into a window on the night sky. When you point your phone up you will see a map of the brightest stars, constellations, and planets in that part of the sky.\nNext time you see a bright star and want to know what it's called, use Sky Map!\nVisible Layers\nSky Map organizes the objects it shows you into layers. Each layer can be toggled using the on-screen controls. The layers are:\nStars\nConstellations\nMessier Objects\nPlanets\nMeteor Showers\nRight Ascension and Declination Grid\nHorizon and cardinal points\n\nThe brightest stars and most prominent constellations are labeled, as are the planets. The planets are displayed as images that are larger than actual size. The horizon is represented as a straight line. Unless you live somewhere that is completely flat and free of buildings, it is likely that Sky Map will show you objects above the horizon line that you are actually unable to see.\n\nOn-screen controls\nTap on the screen to show the on-screen controls. On one side of the screen are the toggles for the layers described above. They are orange when the layers are enabled and white when disabled.\nAlong the bottom of the screen are zoom controls, and a toggle to switch between automatic and manual mode.\n\nNavigation Modes\nWhen first installed Sky Map is in Automatic Mode and uses the phone's sensors to show you a map of the sky in the direction you are holding the phone. By switching into Manual Mode, you can drag the map with your finger to explore the sky. Move the trackball or D-pad left and right to rotate the map. On multitouch phones you can also rotate the map with two fingers and use a pinch gesture to zoom in and out. \n\nSearch\nSky Map helps you answer the question 'What is that star over there?' It can also answer the question 'Where is ...?' Access the search function through the phone's menu button or through the Quick Search Box directly on the Desktop. Start typing in the name of the planet, star or constellation you wish to find and Sky Map will provide a list of matching search items. Select one and Sky Map will display a targeting circle and an arrow showing you how to move the phone (and yourself) to find the object. As you move the phone and close in on the target, the circle will change from blue to red, finally turning orange when the object is within your field of view.\nNote that if you are in Manual Mode, Sky Map will simply move the map to show you the object.\nTo exit Search Mode, tap the small cross in the corner of the screen.\n\nTime Travel\nTime Travel mode enables you to use Sky Map to see the sky at times other than the present. Select 'Time Travel' from the main menu, and then select one of the Popular Dates or choose your own date and time using the 'Change the Date' and 'Change the Time' dialogs. Selections are limited to the years 1900-2100 due to limitations on accuracy, caused mainly by the gravitational influence of Jupiter. When you're done, press 'Go!' to fly through time to your destination. Your Sky Map is now in time travel mode, displaying the date you're visiting, with controls for 'playing' time forwards and backwards from here. Click these buttons once to start moving slowly through time, and several times to travel faster and faster.\nTime Travel can be used to answer a variety of questions, including 'What will I be able to see just after sunset this evening?', 'When will I next have a good chance of seeing Mercury?', and 'According to Hesiod, when should I harvest my grapes?'\n\nHubble Gallery\nSky Map contains a gallery of images from the Hubble telescope. Access the Gallery by selecting the Gallery item in the menu. Once inside the Gallery, you can browse the available images by scrolling with your finger. If you tap one of the thumbnail images, Sky Map shows you the full size image. If you tap the Search button, Sky Map will switch to Search mode to find the object matching the image.\n\nNight Vision Mode\nNight Vision Mode is designed to protect your dark-adapted eyes. When you select the Night Vision menu option, Sky Map will display the map in a red color, dim the screen and switch off the button backlights. Select the option again to revert to normal colors.\n\nSetting Your Location\nSky Map needs your approximate location in order to show you the correct star map. By default, it will determine this from your cellular network. If you are out of range, or have network location disabled it will use your phone's GPS. You can also set your location manually via the settings menu, either by supplying a place name or as a latitude and longitude (in degrees.) Note that Sky Map requires a data connection to determine your latitude and longitude from a place name.\n\nTroubleshooting and Limitations\nThe map is inaccurate.\nIf you find that the map does not accurately line up with the real sky there could be a number of reasons:\n1) Is your compass calibrated? Try holding the phone and rotating your wrist in figures of eight to calibrate it. You may need to repeat this at intervals - this is a feature of the phone, rather than Sky Map.\n2) Does the application have an accurate fix on your location? Is your GPS or network location turned on?\n3) Do you have the correct time and timezone set? Sky Map needs to calculate Universal Time, and it needs your local time AND timezone to do this. If your device has a SIM card then these will usually be set correctly.\n4) Do you have magnetic correction switched on? In some parts of the world the difference between magnetic North and True North can be as much as 20 degrees.\nThe map does not move\nAre you in manual mode? If not, this could be due to an uncalibrated compass. Follow the steps above to 'unstick' it.\n\nCredits\nEngineering, Design and Product Management\nBrent Bryan, Dominic Widdows, Hector Ouilhet, James Powell, John Taylor, Kevin Serafini, Lior Ron\n\nOpen Source Contributors\nChristopher Wilcox, PhD\n\nAcknowledgments\nSky Map was originally developed as Google Sky Map by Google Inc. and open sourced in 2012.
