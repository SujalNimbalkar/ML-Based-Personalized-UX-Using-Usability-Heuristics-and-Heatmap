      "text": "Weather Station Pro has 14 day, Multi-Series graphing, Auto Logging, Moon and Sun info, Ongoing Notification, 2 application Themes, enhanced Widgets, and calibration based on Battery Temperature. To visit the Google Play Store page for Weather Station Pro click the link at the bottom of Preferences.\n\nApplication Details:\n\nTemperature: the ambient temperature. Sensor manufacturers (e.g. Sensirion for the Samsung Galaxy S4) supposedly compensate for internal heat generated by your device. Even so, this reading usually is not accurate unless you leave the device untouched on a table for a few minutes.\n\nPressure: the absolute air pressure (or pressure reduced to mean sea level if you are using the Altimeter Setting). Rising pressure indicates fair weather; falling pressure indicates that stormy weather may be approaching.\n\nRelative Humidity: the ratio of the partial pressure of water vapor to the saturated vapor pressure of water. Outdoors, values approaching 100 % usually indicate it is raining or snowing.\n\nAbsolute Humidity: the mass of water vapor per unit volume of air.\n\nDew Point: the temperature below which water vapor in air will condense into liquid water. Rain and fog usually coincide with the temperature reaching the dew point. Likewise, during the summer months the morning dew means the temperature at the ground has reached the dew point. In the winter the dew freezes and is called frost. A dew point above 65 °F (18 °C) usually indicates \"humid\" or \"muggy\" conditions.\n\nMixing Ratio: (actual) the ratio of the mass of the water vapor to the mass of the dry air.\n\nHeat Index: is an index used by the NOAA National Weather Service to determine how hot it feels.\n\nIlluminance: how bright it is.\n\n|Magnetic Field|: the magnitude of the magnetic field. Higher numbers indicate a source of magnetism or electromagnetism is nearby. Away from these sources the reading indicates the Earth's magnetic field.\n\nBarometric Altitude: the altitude based on the unadjusted (absolute) pressure and the reference Sea Level Pressure (by default 1013.25 mb).\n\nGPS Altitude: the altitude given by the GPS.\n\nDensity Altitude: the Barometric Altitude adjusted for non-standard Temperature and Relative Humidity.\n\nSome Android device manufacturers disable access to hardware sensors while the screen is off. If you notice Background Readings, Widgets, and/or Notifications not updating (and you set them to update) then there is a setting in Preferences (under Troubleshooting) you can try called Screen Wake Lock.\n\nAs of v1.3.0 you can calibrate the values that the sensors are reporting. For example, if you find the temperature being reported is 80 °F and it is actually 70 °F then go to Preferences and under the Troubleshooting->Calibrate Values section there is a Constant Offsets option. Here, you would set the Temperature offset value to -5.55 °C. Please realize that while you are offsetting the value by a constant, the relationship between the actual ambient value and what the sensor is reporting is likely non-linear in time. Thus, using the Constant Offsets option may in most circumstances not be beneficial.\n\nIn the app, you can navigate back to (or restart) the main screen by pressing the Weather Station icon near the top left of the action bar. When Weather Station is no longer in the foreground it can be brought back to its previous state by opening the app from the Recent Apps list. Otherwise, opening Weather Station from the widgets restarts the app to the main screen and opening from regular notifications presents the appropriate graph.\n\nAs of v1.2.0 pressing Share on the main screen or graphs allows you to share a screenshot. The most recent screenshot can be found on your SD Card or Media/Shared Storage directory in the \"weather_station\" folder.\n\nAs of v1.2.0 you can set Notifications under the Background Readings section in Preferences. A notification type is only available if that respective background reading is selected (and enabled). For example, if you choose to not record Background Temperature Readings (or your device does not have an Ambient Temperature sensor) you cannot receive alerts about Temperature, Absolute Humidity, Dew Point, Mixing Ratio, and Heat Index.\n●Many devices have a small LED light for notifications (NOT the same one as what the camera uses). The Flash LED setting is designed to use this small light… but even when selected in the Notifications Preferences your device may decide to ignore this setting. If it does not then Rising alerts are set to flash red and Falling alerts are set to flash blue (except for Pressure, which does the opposite).\n●Even though you must enter the Alert Value in a certain unit, when the notification comes up it will display in the unit of your Preference.\n●Unlike the rising/falling/unchanged indicators, whether to notify or not is based on the most recent background reading with no restriction on when it was taken.\n\nThe rising/falling/unchanged (↑/↓/↔) indicators compare the displayed reading to the most recent background reading from the past day (if there is one available).\n\nThe widgets and ongoing notification are optimized to consume very little battery. If you find the app consuming more battery than you would like, increase the Update Interval and see if it helps. If it does not then as of v1.2.0 you can disable widget and ongoing notification updates by setting the Update Interval to ∞ hours (you can then manually update by pressing a widget/ongoing notification). The Background Readings Time Interval can also be increased to save battery (see ◆ further below).\n\nPressure readings display the actual measurement the sensor reports. In weather contexts, pressure is usually reported after having been reduced to mean sea level. The Altimeter Setting (a.k.a. QNH) in Preferences reduces the pressure to mean sea level using standard atmospheric conditions. It is based on what your Current Elevation/Altitude is. The Altimeter setting is useful if you live at a high elevation (e.g. Denver, CO, USA) or the variance in altitude is large while your device moves (and you want pressure readings reduced to mean sea level).\n●The Use GPS Elevation/Altitude setting gets the current altitude from the device's GPS provider (uses additional battery). Note that the GPS does not actually provide elevation relative to mean sea level and is usually inaccurate. If the GPS is unable to get a fix then the last known elevation from the GPS provider is used. For background readings, widget, and ongoing notification updates, the GPS provider (if enabled) is given at most 90 seconds to obtain a reasonable elevation. Thus, make sure to obtain a fix beforehand (because when first used the GPS provider may take a long time to initialize). If the GPS does not provide elevation or is disabled then the Current Elevation/Altitude is used, whether it was set by you, by the app (the last time it got altitude from GPS), or never set (by default Current Elevation/Altitude is 0 meters).\n●Altimeter setting is not the same as mean sea level pressure (MSLP).\n●Each background pressure reading displayed in the pressure graph is dependent upon the Altimeter Setting (and thus the Current Elevation/Altitude) at the time of that reading.\n●Pressure records set by this device are the absolute (unadjusted) pressure.\n\nSome readings are dependent on multiple sensors. For example, Mixing Ratio depends on Temperature, Pressure, and Relative Humidity.\n\nOnly the last ~7 (or ~14 in the Pro version) days (or less) of readings are graphed. The initial graph view shows only the last day (or less) of background readings. You can reset to the initial graph view by pressing the ∷ button located near the top right of the screen. The graph Details list shows the graphed readings from newest to oldest in the actual order that they were taken. You can Export all available background readings (maximum of 673 or 1346 depending on version) with their Unix timestamps to a tab-delimited text file. This file is saved to your SD Card or Media/Shared Storage directory in the \"weather_station\" folder.\n\nBackground readings begin when you start the app for the first time and they only run if a sensor is available and checked in the Background Readings->Enable/Disable settings section of Preferences. Changes to Background Readings settings in Preferences take effect immediately after the Preferences screen is exited (or put in the background). If you clear the app data, settings are reset to default. However, if background readings/widgets/ongoing notification are running, those readings/widget/ongoing notification updates continue at the previously set Time Interval/Update Interval until you restart the app (enter and leave the Preferences screen for widgets/ongoing notification) or restart your device. If you force stop/close the app you will need to restart it in order for background readings to begin again; enter and leave the Preferences screen to restart widget/ongoing notification updates.\n◆Like the widgets and ongoing notification, background readings are very lightweight. Increasing the Time Interval may help if the app is consuming too much battery for your liking (depending also on if you are using widgets/ongoing notification and on their Update Interval). Unchecking all available sensors in the Background Readings->Enable/Disable settings will disable the readings (no new data will be available for graphing, the rising/falling/unchanged indicators, log files, and regular notifications). With readings disabled and with no widgets/ongoing notification being automatically updated or used, the app will consume zero battery when it is not open.",
