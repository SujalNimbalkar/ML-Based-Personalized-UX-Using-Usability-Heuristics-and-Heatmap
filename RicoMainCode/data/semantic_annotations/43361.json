You can use it on all your Android devices. You just need to download Trenìt! from the Google Play selecting the Android account/email you used to make the purchase.\n\nCan I search a train by number?\nTrain search by number is deliberately not available, as in Italy the number doesn’t univocally define a train: it can happen that two trains have the same number, or that the same train (same route, same time) has a different number in different weekdays, or that the train changes number after a specific station. For this reason it’s always preferable to search by route.\nIf you always take the same train, just click on the button “follow trip” in the detail screen, and then from the “home” screen mark it as favorite (by clicking on the star icon). In this way it will stay on the home screen, and you can access it every day without ever needing to search it again!\n\nWhy there is no widget?\nAndroid widgets are cumbersome to configure and to access. Trenìt! developed the functionality followed trip, which is much easier to use and modify than a widget. By clicking on the “follow trip” button, you can add up to 8 trains in your home screen, and monitor their status.",
