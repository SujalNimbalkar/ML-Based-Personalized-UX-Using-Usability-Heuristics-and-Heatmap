From her dominance at UConn to her more than decade with the Mercury, she has always been the number one option on her team. Even now, as she closes in on the all-time WNBA 3-pointers made record, she achieved a different benchmark that proves she is so much more than just a 3-point threat.\n\nHer second rebound in an 85-62 Mercury win over the Fever gave Taurasi  7,000 points, 1,500 assists, and 1,500 rebounds for her career. How many others have reached that plateau? Not one.\n\nCongratulations to @DianaTaurasi of @PhoenixMercury on becoming the first player in #WNBA history with 7,000 PTS, 1,500 AST & 1,500 REB! pic.twitter.com/8X8pbHklXj\n\n— WNBA (@WNBA) May 18, 2017\n\nWith just five more triples to go for the 3-point mark, Taurasi seems primed for a stat-filled start to the season, and more space in the history books. It’s likely that later this summer she will become the all-time leading scorer in league history. It’s no wonder the Mercury made it a priority to give Taurasi a multi-year extension in an effort to keep her for the duration of her WNBA career. All the rest that’s left to decide is her place among the all-time greats.\n\nThe post Diana Taurasi Makes History appeared first on WNBA.com - Official Site of the WNBA.\n\n",
