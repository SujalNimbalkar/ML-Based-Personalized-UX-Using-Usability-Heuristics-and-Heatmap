If you are using the Services on behalf of an organization or entity (“Organization”), then you are agreeing to these Terms on behalf of that Organization and you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind the Organization to these Terms. In that case, “you” and “your” refers to you and that Organization. You may use the Service only if you can form a binding contract with Social Network All in One, and only in compliance with these Terms and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules and regulations. The Service may change from time to time as we evolve, refine or add more features to the Service, often without prior notice to you.
