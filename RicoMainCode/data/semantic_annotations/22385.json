She agreed that it was romantic, and she found that it provided a very nice, soft light that we could use for reading. I took this as permission to let my bedrooms ideas go wild. Since that day, I have done all kinds of different experimenting. Of course, I started off by buying some new linens for the bed. I bought expensive Egyptian cotton sheets, something that I considered a worthwhile investment. After all, having a comfortable night of sleep is one of the most important things that there is. I also bought a brightly colored down comforter, printed with pictures of animals, flowers, and exotic forest scenery. Somehow, it brightened up the whole bedroom.",
