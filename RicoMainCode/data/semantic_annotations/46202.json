Marc Herrera, but the first two times the charges did not stick.  \tProsecutors want to be able to use that quote as evidence in Herrera's upcoming trial, and on Wednesday a judge agreed even after the defense said there was more to the story.  \tThere was a party at the Herrera's home. The guests were a group of UNM foreign exchange students. It was getting late. According to testimony in previous hearings, the students said Marc Herrera came home drunk, pointed a gun at them and left the room.  \tMinutes later, they heard the gun go off and Herrera was dead.  \tAt first, Amy Herrera said it was suicide. But according to her lawyer, it was self-defense.  \tFast forward to Wednesday in court.  \t\"All I have pending before me is the defense's motion to exclude the alleged statement by the defendant and, I quote, 'I wish I could kill him again,' end quote,\" Judge Brett Lovelace said.  \tProsecutors said Amy Herrera said those exact words to an acquaintance about two weeks after her husband's death, but the defense said Herrera's words were taken out of context.  \t\"Ms. Herrera was going through credit card bills and some of her husband's documents after his death,\" the defense said. \"She found credit card statements showing that he had been a member of AshleyMadison.com and other websites showing that he was either contemplating having a sexual extramarital affair or already having one.\"  \tAmy Herrera's lawyer said that quote was immediately after she learned of this and she called her friend to vent and that she already admitted to killing him in self-defense to the grand jury under oath anyway.  \tProsecutors argued that all statements should be allowed into evidence considering the nature of the case.  \t\"Essentially in a murder case, any statement from the defendant where they admitted killing the decedent ought to be relevant for the trial on the murder,\" the prosecutor said.  \tThe judge agreed with the prosecution.  \tAmy Herrera is charged with first-degree murder. Her trial is scheduled for the end of July.  \tProsecutors dismissed the first indictment in 2013. It was argued that two APD officers improperly demonstrated their version of the shooting before the grand jury.  \tThe second indictment was tossed as well after the state Supreme Court ruled the prosecution did not instruct the grand jury in a \"fair and impartial manner.\" (Copyright 2017 KOB-TV LLC, a Hubbard Broadcasting Company.

The girls were ages 14, 11, 7 and 3; the wife was around 35 years old.  \tVillegas reportedly fled to Mexico after the murders.  \tNew Mexico law enforcement agencies asked the Marshals for help in finding Villegas, Marshal Conrad Candelaria said in a statement. They found Villegas in Sonora, Mexico and Mexican authorities apprehended him.  \tVillegas was returned to the United States and Marshals turned him over to the Chavez County Sheriff's Office, Candelaria said.  \t\"With justice at hand, now our community can be one step closer to healing from this inconceivable act that struck at the core of the New Mexico community,\" he said.  \t Click here to read the grand jury indictment against Villegas on five counts of first-degree murder, among other charges .  \tNew Mexico Attorney Hector Balderas visited Mexico's attorney general, Raul Cervantes Andrade, to thank him for his country's assistance in apprehending Villegas, communications director James Hallinan said. A treaty between the United States and Mexico allows for the extradition of suspects in violent crimes and child abuse cases.  \t\"Today we begin the process of bringing justice against Juan David Villegas, who rocked the community of Roswell and the entire state when he allegedly murdered his own family and fled to Mexico,\" Balderas said.
