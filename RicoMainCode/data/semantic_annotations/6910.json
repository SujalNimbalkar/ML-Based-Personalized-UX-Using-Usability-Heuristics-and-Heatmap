A few quick reminders:\n\n• You must add items to your merchant shopping cart immediately after clicking from the ShopAtHome app.\n\n• Your purchase must meet the Cash Back Terms listed on ShopAtHome.com. If you have questions on what earns Cash Back from a particular merchant, visit their store page on ShopAtHome.com and click \"View Our Cash Back Terms\" near the top of the page.\n\n• You must only use coupons offered by ShopAtHome.com and only those that specifically state \"plus Cash Back\". Using coupons from any other source, including those sent in a merchant email or direct mail offer, those listed on other coupon or Cash Back sites, or those listed on ShopAtHome.com that do not state \"plus Cash Back\" will disqualify your purchase for Cash Back eligibility.\n\n\nHave more questions?
