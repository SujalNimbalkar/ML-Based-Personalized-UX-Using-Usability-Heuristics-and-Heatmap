We do not sell the App to you. We remain the owners of the App at all times.\n\nOperating system requirements This App is available for products running iOS and Android software. Although the App and any downloaded modules will reside on your device, you will need internet access in order to download additional modules to the App or to benefit from other functionality and updates.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTICE:\n\nBY DOWNLOADING THE APP OR CLICKING ON THE \"ACCEPT\" BUTTON BELOW YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS LICENCE WHICH WILL BIND YOU. The terms of the licence include, in particular, the privacy policy defined in condition 1.5 and limitations on liability in condition 8.\n\nIf you do not agree to the terms of this licence, we will not license the App to you and you will not be able to access any modules or other functions of the App.\n\nAs a consumer, you have a right, for any reason, to cancel a transaction within 7 days of entering into a contract, such as this licence.\n\nHowever, by agreeing to this licence, you expressly consent to being provided with access to the App straight away, and you acknowledge that you will lose your right to cancel the transaction once you agree to this licence.\n\nThis does not affect your consumer rights for an app that is defective.\n\nYou should print a copy of this EULA for future reference.\n\nAGREED TERMS:\n\n1. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\n1.1 The terms of this EULA apply to the App and to any of the services or functionality (including the operation modules available for download) accessible through the App (\"Services\"), including any updates that replace or supplement the App or any Service, unless they come with separate terms, in which case those terms apply. If any open-source software is included in the App or any Service, the terms of an open-source licence may override some of the terms of this EULA.\n\n1.2 We may change these terms at any time by sending you an e-mail or in-App message with details of the change or notifying you of a change when you next start the App. The new terms may be displayed on-screen and you may be required to read and accept them to continue your use of the Services.\n\n1.3 From time to time updates to the App may be issued through the Appstore. Depending on the update, you may not be able to use the Services until you have downloaded the latest version of the App and accepted any new terms.\n\n1.4 You will be assumed to have obtained permission from the owners of the mobile devices described in condition 3.2 (\"Devices\") that are controlled, but not owned, by you to download a copy of the App onto these Devices. You and they may be charged by your and their service providers for internet access on the Devices. You accept responsibility in accordance with the terms of this EULA for the use of the App or any Service on or in relation to any Device, whether or not it is owned by you.\n\n1.5 The terms of our privacy policy from time to time, available at http://www.touchsurgery.com/privacy/ (\"Privacy Policy\") are incorporated into this EULA by reference and apply to your use of the App and the Services. Additionally, by using the App or any Service, you acknowledge and agree that internet transmissions are never completely private or secure. You understand that any message or information you send using the App or any Service may be read or intercepted by others, even if there is a special notice that a particular transmission is encrypted.\n\n1.6 By using the App or any of the Services, you consent to us collecting and using technical information about the Devices and related software, hardware and peripherals to facilitate the provision of software updates or otherwise to improve our products and to provide any Services to you.\n\n1.7 The App or any Service may contain links to other independent third-party websites (\"Third-party Sites\"). Third-party Sites are not under our control, and we are not responsible for and do not endorse their content or their privacy policies (if any). You will need to make your own independent judgement regarding your interaction with any Third-party Sites, including the purchase and use of any products or services accessible through them. You also acknowledge that, if we enable third parties to add content directly to the App or Services or to submit marketing messages or other communications within the App, we will not be responsible for such content, messages or communications. However, we will comply with the Privacy Policy in relation to any third party marketing, and will investigate promptly if we receive any complaints about third party content.\n\n1.8 The App has been designed for users residing in the U.K. and we make no representation that the App or Services are appropriate for, or permitted to be used in, any other location. You are therefore responsible for ensuring that you comply with all applicable laws in your location in relation to your downloading and use of the App and the Services. If we become aware of any legal or other risk associated with the availability of the App or the Services, whether in a particular location or more generally, we reserve the right to change, suspend, withdraw or disable access to the App or Services at any time without notice, and we shall have no liability to you in respect of such action.\n\n1.9 You represent and warrant that:\n\n1.9.1 you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a \"terrorist supporting country\"; and\n\n1.9.2 you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.\n\n1.10 Any words following the terms including, include, in particular or for example or any similar phrase shall be construed as illustrative and shall not limit the generality of the related general words.\n\n2. TERMS RELATING TO APPSTORES\n\n2.1 We and you both acknowledge and agree that:\n\n2.1.1 the EULA is concluded between you and Kinosis Limited only, and not with the Appstore providers;\n\n2.1.2 we, not the Appstore providers, are solely responsible for the App and the content thereof;\n\n2.1.3 App store providers have no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the App;\n\n2.1.4 in the event of any third party claim that the App or your possession and use of the App infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights, we, and not the app store provider, will be solely responsible for the investigation, defence, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim;\n\n2.1.5 we, and not the app store provider, are responsible for addressing any claims made by you or any third party relating to the App or your possession and/or use of the App, including, but not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the App fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation; and\n\n2.1.6 The app store provider, and subsidiaries, are third party beneficiaries of this EULA, and that, upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions of the EULA, the app store provider will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce the EULA against you as a third party beneficiary thereof.\n\n2.2 In the event of any failure of the App to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify the app store provider, and the app store provider will refund the purchase price for the App to you, if any price has been paid. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the app store provider will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the App, and any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty will be our sole responsibility.\n\n3. GRANT AND SCOPE OF LICENCE\n\n3.1 In consideration of you agreeing to abide by the terms of this EULA, we grant you a non-transferable, non-exclusive licence to use the App on the Devices, subject to these terms, the Privacy Policy and the Appstore Rules (including the Usage Rules), both of which are incorporated into this EULA by reference. We reserve all other rights.\n\n3.2 You may download a copy of the App to, and view, use and display the App on, any device that you own or control for your personal purposes only, and as permitted by the Usage Rules.\n\n4. LICENCE RESTRICTIONS\n\nExcept as expressly set out in this EULA or as permitted by any local law, you agree:\n\n4.1 not to copy the App except where such copying is incidental to normal use of the App, or where it is necessary for the purpose of back-up or operational security;\n\n4.2 not to rent, lease, sub-license, loan, translate, merge, adapt, vary or modify the App;\n\n4.3 not to make alterations to, or modifications of, the whole or any part of the App, or permit the App or any part of it to be combined with, or become incorporated in, any other programs;\n\n4.4 not to disassemble, decompile, reverse-engineer or create derivative works based on the whole or any part of the App or attempt to do any such thing except to the extent that (by virtue of section 296A of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988) such actions cannot be prohibited because they are essential for the purpose of achieving inter-operability of the App with another software program, and provided that the information obtained by you during such activities:\n\n4.4.1 is used only for the purpose of achieving inter-operability of the App with another software program;\n\n4.4.2 is not unnecessarily disclosed or communicated without our prior written consent to any third party; and\n\n4.4.3 is not used to create any software that is substantially similar to the App;\n\n4.5 to keep all copies of the App secure and to maintain accurate and up-to-date records of the number and locations of all copies of the App;\n\n4.6 to include our copyright notice on all entire and partial copies you make of the App on any medium;\n\n4.7 not to provide or otherwise make available the App in whole or in part (including object and source code), in any form to any person without prior written consent from us; and\n\n4.8 to comply with all technology control or export laws and regulations that apply to the technology used or supported by the App or any Service (\"Technology\"),\n\ntogether \"Licence Restrictions\".\n\n5. ACCEPTABLE USE RESTRICTIONS\n\nYou must:\n\n5.1 not use the App or any Service in any unlawful manner, for any unlawful purpose, or in any manner inconsistent with this EULA, or act fraudulently or maliciously, for example, by hacking into or inserting malicious code, including viruses, or harmful data, into the App, any Service or any operating system;\n\n5.2 not infringe our intellectual property rights or those of any third party in relation to your use of the App or any Service (to the extent that such use is not licensed by this EULA);\n\n5.3 not transmit any material that is defamatory, offensive or otherwise objectionable in relation to your use of the App or any Service;\n\n5.4 not use the App or any Service in a way that could damage, disable, overburden, impair or compromise our systems or security or interfere with other users; and\n\n5.5 not collect or harvest any information or data from any Service or our systems or attempt to decipher any transmissions to or from the servers running any Service,\n\ntogether \"Acceptable Use Restrictions\".\n\n6. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS\n\n6.1 You acknowledge that all intellectual property rights in the App, the Technology and in all content, information and material made available to you via the App and Technology, wherever in the world such rights arise, belong to us, Apple or our licensors, that these rights are licensed (not sold) to you, and that you have no rights in, or to, the App, Technology, content, information or material other than the right to use each of them in accordance with the terms of this EULA.\n\n6.2 Without prejudice to condition 6.1, as between you and us, we own the intellectual property rights in the \"Touch Surgery\" name and mark, and we have a pending application for the registration of \"Touch Surgery\" as a trade mark.\n\n6.3 You acknowledge that you have no right to have access to the App in source-code form.\n\n7. NO WARRANTY\n\n7.1 We do not offer or provide any warranties or representations in relation to the quality or performance of the App, nor do we guarantee that the App and Services will always be available or that access to them will be uninterrupted. Subject to condition 7.2, we will not be liable to you if for any reason the App or Services do not perform as described or are unavailable at any time or for any period. \n\n7.2 Nothing in this condition 7 detracts from any default legal rights you may have in relation to digital content or services that are faulty or not as described. Advice about your legal rights is available from your local Citizens' Advice Bureau or Trading Standards office.\n\n8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY\n\n8.1 You acknowledge that the App has not been developed to meet your individual requirements, and that it is therefore your responsibility to ensure that the facilities and functions of the App meet your requirements.\n\n8.2 We only supply the App for domestic and private use. You agree not to use the App for any commercial, business or resale purposes, and we have no liability to you for any loss of profit, loss of business, business interruption, or loss of business opportunity.\n\n8.3 Although we make reasonable efforts to update the information on the App, we make no representations, warranties or guarantees, whether express or implied, that the content on the App is accurate, complete or up-to-date.\n\n8.4 The content on the App is provided for educational, research, and reference purposes only. It has been created as an aid to surgical training, and is not designed to replace or substitute real life operative experience, a recognised surgical training program or the advice of a qualified health care professional and should not be used for these purposes. It is not intended to amount to advice on which you should rely. Do not disregard or avoid professional medical advice or delay seeking it because of materials made available through the App. The content of the App has not been endorsed or approved by any governmental body or by any medical association or organisation.\n\n8.5 We are only responsible for loss or damage you suffer that is a foreseeable result of our breach of this EULA or our negligence up to the limit specified in condition 8.6.

TERMINATION\n\n9.1 We may terminate this EULA immediately by written notice to you:\n\n9.1.1 if you commit a material or persistent breach of this EULA which you fail to remedy (if remediable) within 14 days after the service of written notice requiring you to do so; or\n\n9.1.2 if you breach any of the Licence Restrictions or the Acceptable Use Restrictions\n\n9.2 On termination for any reason:\n\n9.2.1 all rights granted to you under this EULA shall cease;\n\n9.2.2 you must immediately cease all activities authorised by this EULA, including your use of any Services; and\n\n9.2.3 you must immediately delete or remove the App from all Devices and immediately destroy all copies of the App then in your possession, custody or control and certify to us that you have done so.\n\n10. COMMUNICATION BETWEEN US\n\n10.1 If you wish to contact us in writing, or if any condition in this EULA requires you to give us notice in writing, you can send this to us by e-mail at info@Touch-Surgery.com or by prepaid post to Kinosis Limited at Lower Ground Floor, 17-18 Hayward’s Place, London, England, EC1R OEQ.

OTHER IMPORTANT TERMS\n\n11.1 We may transfer our rights and obligations under this EULA to another organisation, but this will not affect your rights under this EULA.\n\n11.2 You may only transfer your rights or obligations under this EULA to another person if we agree in writing.\n\n11.3 If we fail to insist that you perform any of your obligations under this EULA, or if we do not enforce our rights against you, or if we delay in doing so, that will not mean that we have waived our rights against you and will not mean that you do not have to comply with those obligations. If we do waive a default by you, we will only do so in writing, and that will not mean that we will automatically waive any later default by you.\n\n11.4 Each of the conditions of this EULA operates separately. If any court or competent authority decides that any of them are unlawful or unenforceable, the remaining conditions will remain in full force and effect.\n\n11.5 Please note that this EULA, its subject matter and its formation, are governed by English law. You and we both agree that the courts of England and Wales will have exclusive jurisdiction, to the extent that this is permitted by law, and subject to the following exceptions:\n\n11.5.1 if you are a resident of Northern Ireland you may also bring proceedings in Northern Ireland, and if you are resident of Scotland, you may also bring proceedings in Scotland; and\n\n11.5.2 we shall have the right to bring proceedings for injunctive relief in any jurisdiction.",
