      "text": "False labor contractions\n\nThe entire womanâ€™s body prepares for the upcoming childbirth, but the uterus carries out some special work. False labor contractions (Braxton Hicks contractions) can be considered as a training. These are individual uterine contractions, which are painless, do not affect sleep, are rare and have long intervals between each other. False contractions occur by the end of pregnancy. If you feel the contractions in the first or second trimester, your doctor should confirm or exclude the pathology of pregnancy. Please consult your gynecologist in case of any contractions.\n\nContractions in the first stage of labor\n\nThe first stage of childbirth is characterized by the start of regular labor. During this time the woman feels contractions, which are light in the beginning, but become stronger hour after hour. During each contraction the diameter of the orifice of uterus increases. The cervical dilatation up to 10-12 cm is called full dilatation. The speed of cervical dilatation is individual! The latent phase of the first stage of labor is the phase from the onset of labor until the changes in the cervix. During the active phase the cervical dilatation occurs more quickly. Once the orifice of uterus reaches the necessary size the lowering of the fetal head occurs.\n\nContractions in the second stage of labor\n\nThe second stage of labor is called fetal expulsion. During this phase the baby is born. In the second stage of labor bearing-down joins the contractions. Intrauterine pressure becomes very strong, contractions and bearing-down intensity increases, allowing the child to travel down the birth canal. During bearing-down crowning and aftercoming of the fetal head occur. Crowning means that the head appears during bearing-down and then disappears. Aftercoming means that the fetal head does not disappear from the vaginal introitus without bearing-down. During the bearing-down the woman should take a deep breath, and then make a continuous breathing-out. During one contraction the woman usually makes bearing-down three times (this process is monitored by the doctor and obstetrician). After some attempts the fetal head is born - it becomes fully visible in the vaginal introitus, then in the absence of problems the baby is born in a short time.\n\nContractions in the third stage of labor\n\nThe placenta, umbilical cord and fetal membranes form the retained placenta. It is expelled in the last stage of labor (after the birth of the child). This period is called the involution stage, it takes about 15-30 minutes. Placental expulsion does not cause pronounced discomfort even with the light contractions.",
