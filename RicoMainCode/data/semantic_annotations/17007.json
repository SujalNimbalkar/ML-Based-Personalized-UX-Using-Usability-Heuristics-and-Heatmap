Anxiety at this level generally causes symptoms and significant lifestyle impairment. Anxiety in this range could be classified as anxiety disorder.\n\nSUGGESTIONS= The factors that cause anxiety at this level are more complex than in lower degrees. Therefore, anxiety at this level almost always requires accessing good self-help information and working with an experienced anxiety disorder therapist/coach, preferably one who has experienced and overcome anxiety disorder in his/her own life. That level of personal experience and professional training is an invaluable asset when overcoming anxiety disorder.\n\nEven though anxiety at this level generally causes major lifestyle impairment, it is still fully reversible by addressing the factors and behaviors at the root of problematic anxiety. So, no one needs to suffer needlessly. Getting the right help and doing the right work can bring lasting success.\nBecause anxiety at this level doesn't resolve on its own, getting the right help and doing the right work is imperative. Immediate action is required.\nNevertheless, anxiety at any level can be successfully resolved with the right information, help, and support.\nIf you have scored in this range, there is a lot you can do to eliminate your struggle with anxiety issues. Anxiety disorder is not something you have to live with.\n",
