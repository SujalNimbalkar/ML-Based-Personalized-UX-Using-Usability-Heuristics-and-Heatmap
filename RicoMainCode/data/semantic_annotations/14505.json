You can add as many vehicles as you would like and may edit or delete them as you choose.\n\nThe primary feature is to store and track your gas mileage (MPG). This can be done using either your tripometer (recommended) or your odometer. At every fill up, fill your gas tank all the way and enter the mileage on your tripometer along with the other data points and then reset your tripometer.\n\nIf you are using your odometer, be sure that the odometer value under 'Vehicle Settings' matches your odometer at your last fill up. This is how we calculate the number of miles you've driven between trips to the gas station.\n\nYou can view your log data in table or graph form. The 'Fill Up Log Graph' can zoom using the normal pinch in and out gestures that are used on maps.\n\nWe will update your odometer as you add fill ups and notify you when you have hit the mileage that you have set to be your next oil change.\n\nYou can also add services such as oil changes and transmission fluid exchange. These can be added by selecting 'Add Service' from the context menu. The more detail you enter the more information you can have at your disposal when you need it. We will build new features in the future around services.\n\nMPG Tracker uses Google Analytics to help improve the user experience. Please be aware that we only use this information improve the tool.\n\nFinally, if you have a suggestion for improvement, please email us via webmaster@3dx2.com. Thank you for using MPG Tracker! Enjoy!",
