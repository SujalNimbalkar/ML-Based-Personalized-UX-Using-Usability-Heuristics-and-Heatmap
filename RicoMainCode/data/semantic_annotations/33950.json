There are said to be seven main chakras in all; four in our upper body, which govern our mental properties, and three in the lower body, which govern our instinctual properties.\n\nThey are:\n1. Muladhara (Root Chakra)\n2. Svadhishthana (Sacral Chakra)\n3. Manipura (Solar Plexus Chakra)\n4. Anahata (Heart Chakra)\n5. Vishuddha (Throat Chakra)\n6. Ajna (Third Eye Chakra)\n7. Sahasrara (Crown Chakra)\n\nAll of the chakras should contribute to a human's well-being. Our instincts would join forces with our feelings and thinking. Some of our chakras are open partially, some may be over-active and others near closed. If the chakras are not balanced, peace with the self cannot be achieved.\n\nChakras (wheels) are energy points or nodes in the our body. The term nadi (pronounced as naadi) roughly associates to the channels in our nervous system. Of this, the Spinal Chord (Sushumna) corresponds to the main energy channel that carries the vital energy (prana) that keeps us alive. Chakras are the major energy nodes in this Nadi system. There are many chakras in the human body according to the tantric texts, but there are seven chakras that are considered to be the most important ones.\n\nThe following features are common for all chakras:\n\n1. They form part of the body, along with the breath channels, or nadis, and the winds (vayus).\n\n2. They are located along the central channel, the spinal chord (sushumna).\n\n3. Two side channels cross the center channel at the location of the chakras.\n\n4. They possess a number of 'petals' or 'spokes'.\n\n5. The body and mind is healthy when the flow of energy through these chakras is smooth.\n\n6. Ill health and imbalances in the body and mind affect one or more of the chakras. \n\n7. When a chakra becomes stronger, it has a positive impact on the mind and body.\n\n8. They are generally associated with a mantra seed-syllable and resonant frequencies. \n\n9. They have certain colors and qualities. The seven main chakras pertain to the visible light spectrum as in a rainbow.\n\nChakra Meditation involves listening to the mantra and sound frequencies associated with each of the chakras, visualizng the associated symbols and colors and trying to focus on the specific locations of these chakras in our body.\n\nRoutinely practicing Chakra Meditation for one or more chakras, helps in overcoming any imbalances associated with those chakras as well as strengthening it associated aspects and behaviors, thus leading to a healthy body and mind.\n\nThe chakras are thought to vitalize the physical body and to be associated with interactions of a physical, emotional and mental nature. They are considered loci of life energy or prana (also called shakti, qi in Chinese, ki in Japanese, koach-ha-guf in Hebrew, bios in Greek, and aether in both Greek and English), which is thought to flow among them along pathways called nadis.\n\nThe function of the chakras is to spin and draw in this energy to keep the spiritual, mental, emotional and physical health of the body in balance. They are said to reflect how the unified consciousness of humanity (the immortal human being or the soul) is divided to manage different aspects of earthly life (body, instinct, vital energy, deeper emotions, communication, an overview of life or contact to God). The chakras are placed at differing levels of spiritual subtlety, with Sahasrara at the top, concerned with pure consciousness, and Muladhara at the bottom, concerned with more material things.\n\nIf you are opening your chakras, there is no need to try and make over-active chakras less active. They are simply compensating for the inactivity of closed chakras. Once all of the chakras are opened, the energy evens out, and becomes balanced.\n\n\n\nYou can access this Help Page anytime from the Menu. The info (i) button provides details and meditation instructions for individual chakras.\n\n",
