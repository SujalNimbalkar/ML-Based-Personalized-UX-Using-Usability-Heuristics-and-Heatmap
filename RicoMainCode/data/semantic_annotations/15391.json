By being obedient to the Father, He defeated sin, death and Satan. Mary, pray to Your Son, who is the Giver of Life, that every conceived child be protected from abortion.\n\n2. The Ascension of Jesus to Heaven\n\nForty days after the Resurrection, Jesus Christ ascended into Heaven to sit on the right hand of the Father. He promised to stay with people until the end of the world. Mary, we beg you to be our intercessor and pray for Christâ€™s presence inside each family where a new life is born.\n\n3. The Descent of the Holy Ghost\n\nSitting on the right hand of God, Jesus sends us His Holy Spirit as the first gift for those who believe. The Holy Ghost teaches and leads the Church until the Final Judgement. Mary, may you pray to God and request for us the gifts of courage to preach and propagate the protection of life. \n\n4. The Assumption of Mary into Heaven\n\nMary was honored for Her complete obedience and taken into Heaven. She is the first human who is fully united with God, with Her body and soul. Mary, we pray for your intercession over us who are sinful, now and in the hour of our death. \n\n5. Mary is crowned as Queen of Heaven and Earth\n\nMary was crowned the Queen of Heaven and Earth. Our Queen is the first and the most beautiful creation among all. Mary, you were especially chosen and gifted by God; show us the attitude of service, which is honored with the place in Heaven.\n\n",
