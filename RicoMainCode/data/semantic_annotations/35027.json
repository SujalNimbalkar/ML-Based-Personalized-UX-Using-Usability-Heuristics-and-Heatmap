It is to build self-esteem and intuition, hear your truth, make wise, skillful choices, improve communication, increase creativity and productivity, and let go.\r\n\r\nIf you've tried meditation thinking it would be quiet and peaceful you have probably been surprised to discover that it is quite a challenge. In a Zen meditative practice you are taught to meditate often for hours at a time in a seated position with an emphasis on maintaining a fixed posture. Usually, one's posture slips as the meditation wears on and this is believed to adversely affect the meditation.\r\n\r\nAt the core of meditation is the goal to focus and eventually quiet your mind, thus freeing your awareness. As you progress, you will find that you can meditate anywhere and at any time, accessing an inner calm no matter what's going on around you. You will also find that you can better control your reactions to things as you become increasingly aware of your thoughts (letting go of anger, for example). But first, you have to learn to tame your mind and control your breathing.",
