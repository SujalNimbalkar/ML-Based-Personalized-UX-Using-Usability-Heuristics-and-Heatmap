But when Galactus died in one of the alternate universes, the balance between Abraxas and the Multiverse disappeared.\n\nAbraxas traveled the Multiverse using the head of a Galactus as a beacon to travel to other alternate universes. Abraxas plan was to travel to the conventional Marvel Universe, Ultimate Nullifier seize and destroy the last Galactus with him. Thus, Abraxas could melt Multiverso one. However, the plan Abraxas threatened to tear the fabric of reality and destroying the Multiverse.\n\nTo do this, Abraxas hid his herald, Nova, in its beacon, and this was part of the Fantastic 4 for a while. Nova accompanied the Human Torch during his quest for Ultimate Nullifier. But when the Fantastic Four managed to complete the Nullifier location, Nova gave the gun to Abraxas.\n\nFantastic 4 Abraxas faced, but he defended his Nov√°ngeles (a command of Novas alternative dimensions) and of itself. As a last hope, Franklin Richards used his powers to call Galactus. When he appeared, Abraxas used the Ultimate Nullifier against him. However, Galactus shown to be immune to the effects of the Nullifier, and it fell into the hands of Reed Richards. Reed used the Nullifier to destroy the multiverse, back to the time of the Big Bang, and preventing Abraxas born.",
