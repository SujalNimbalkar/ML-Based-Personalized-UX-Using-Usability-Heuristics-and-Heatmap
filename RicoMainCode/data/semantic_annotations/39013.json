What’s next? How do you find battles that you can actually win? It turns out that you can do it randomly. Just pick the closest gym you can find and head into the battle. But before you do that, check out this following trick that will let you win regardless of your opposition.the trick isn’t a cheat. Instead, it’s a way of taking advantage of what happens on the screen during the battle. All you need to do is apply a particular strategy and stick to it until the Pokemon you’re facing dies.Here goes: look out for a yellow flash of your opponent, and then immediately dodge the impending attack. After that, land an attack of your own, or maybe two if you’re lucky. Simply rinse and repeat, and you’ll be able to emerge victorious in any battle — even if the Pokemon you’re facing has a lot more life than your minions.The trick here is acting fast to dodge an imminent attack. That means the strategy will not work if you have network connection problems, or if your phone is an older model that’s doesn’t run the game smoothly. Any lag whatsoever might get in the way of this winning strategy.",
