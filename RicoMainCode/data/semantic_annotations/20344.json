          "text": "\nWhen announced, the abolition of high-value banknotes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 rupees came as a bolt from the blue . \n\nThe secrecy was aimed at outflanking those who might profit from prior knowledge, by pouring cash into gold, property and other assets and hide illicit wealth. \n\nPreviously unreported details of Modi's handling of the so-called \"demonetisation\" open a window onto the hands-on role he played in implementing a key policy, and how he was willing to act quickly even when the risks were high. \n\nWhile some advocates say the scrapping of the banknotes will bring more money into the banking system and raise tax revenues, many Indians are furious at having to queue for hours outside banks to exchange or deposit their old money. \n\nMoreover, not enough replacement notes were printed in preparation for the upheaval, and it could take months for things to return to normal. \n\nWith Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state, holding an election in early 2017 that could decide Modi's chances of a second term in office, there is little time for the hoped-for benefits of his cash swap to outweigh short-term pain. \n\nModi has staked his reputation and popularity on the move. \n\n\"I have done all the research and, if it fails, then I am to blame,\" Modi told a cabinet meeting on November 8 shortly before the move was announced, according to three ministers who attended. \n\nDirect line to Modi \n\nOverseeing the campaign, with support from the backroom team camped out at Modi's sprawling bungalow in the capital, was Adhia, a top finance ministry official. \n\nThe 58-year-old served as principal secretary to Modi from 2003-06 when he was the chief minister of Gujarat, establishing a relationship of trust with his boss and introducing him to yoga. \n\nColleagues interviewed by Reuters said he had a reputation for integrity and discretion. \n\nAdhia was named revenue secretary in September 2015, reporting formally to finance minister Arun Jaitley. In reality, he had a direct line to Modi and they would speak in their native Gujarati when they met to discuss issues in depth. \n\nIn the world's largest democracy the demonetisation was revolutionary: it called into question the state's promise to \"pay the bearer\" the face value on every banknote. \n\nAt a stroke, Modi scrapped money worth 15.4 trillion rupees ($220 billion), equal to 86 percent of cash in Asia's third-largest economy. \n\nThe idea is backed by some economists, although the speed of its implementation is widely seen as radical. \n\n\"One is never ready for this kind of disruption - but it is a constructive disruption,\" said Narendra Jadhav, a 31-year veteran and former chief economist of India's central bank who now represents BJP in the Rajya Sabha. \n\nModi, in his TV address to the nation, cautioned that people could face temporary hardship as replacement 500 and 2,000 rupee notes were introduced. Calling for an act of collective sacrifice, he promised steps to soften the blow for the nine in 10 Indians who live in the cash economy. \n\n\"Biggest, boldest step\" \n\nImmediately after the address, Adhia sent a tweet: \"This is the biggest and the boldest step by the government for containing black money.\" \n\nThe boast harked back to Modi's election vow to recover black money from abroad that had resonated with voters fed up with the corruption scandals that plagued the last Congress government. Yet in office, he struggled to keep his promise. \n\nOver more than a year, Modi commissioned research from officials at the finance ministry, the central bank and think-tanks on how to advance his fight against black money, a close aide said. \n\nHe demanded answers to questions such as: How quickly India could print new banknotes; how to distribute them; would state banks benefit if they received a rush of new deposits; and who would gain from demonetisation? \n\nThe topics were broken up to prevent anyone from joining the dots and concluding that a cash swap was in the offing. \n\n\"We didn't want to let the cat out of the bag,\" said a senior official directly involved. \"Had people got a whiff of the decision, the whole exercise would have been meaningless.\" \n\nUnder Adhia's oversight, the team of researchers assembled and modeled the findings in what was, for it, a theoretical exercise. \n\nIt was made up of young experts in data and financial analysis; some ran Modi's social media accounts and a smartphone app that he used to solicit public feedback. \n\nYet for all the planning, Modi and Adhia knew they could not foresee every eventuality, and were willing to move swiftly. \n\nThe announcement caused chaos, with huge queues forming at banks when they reopened after a short holiday. \n\nNew 2,000 rupee notes were hard to come by and barely any new 500 rupee notes had been printed. India's 200,000 cash dispensers could not handle the new, smaller, notes and it would take weeks to reconfigure them. \n\nFilling ATMs with the 8 trillion rupees ($117 billion) in new banknotes that the finance ministry reckons are needed to restore liquidity to the economy is even trickier. \n\nIn a best-case scenario, in which India's four banknote presses churned out new 500 and 2,000 rupee notes designed to replace the abolished ones, it would take at least three months to hit that target. \n\nSecrecy paramount \n\nSecrecy was paramount, but clues had been left. \n\nBack in April, analysts at State Bank of India said that demonetisation of large-denomination notes was possible. \n\nThe Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, also disclosed in May that it was making preparations for a new series of banknotes that were confirmed in August when it announced it had approved a design for a new 2,000 rupee note. \n\nThe printing presses had only just started turning when the media finally started to run with the story in late October. \n\n\"The plan was to introduce it around November 18, but there was a clear sign that it could get leaked,\" said one person with direct knowledge who, like others interviewed by Reuters, asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. \n\nSome officials in the finance ministry had expressed doubts about scrapping high-value notes when the idea came up for discussion. They now feel resentment at the secrecy in which Adhia rammed through the plan on Modi's orders. \n\nThey also say the plan was flawed because of a failure to ramp up printing of new notes ahead of time. \n\nOther critics say the Adhia team fell prey to a form of \"group think\" that ignored outside advice. \n\nIn the words of one former top official who has worked at the finance ministry and central bank: \"They don't know what's happening in the real world.\" \n\nRead this story in Marathi \n",

Adequate training should be provided through TV channels, training camps etc for rapid adoption. 2) Legislation which mandates as many payments as possible through cheques, e-payments, FT’s etc i.e. non cash with penalties for traders / service providers who demand cash payment. The population needs to be brought out of “cash” habit / syndrome by force. Exceptions should only be made for digitally illiterate Senior Citizens & handicapped. 3) Scrap Income Tax and replace the same with expenditure tax. And even the expenditure tax should be simple so as to facilitate logical and seamless interphasing with GST on a cascading taxation based on value addition. We have to make our indirect taxation structure simple and rewarding for the more productive and innovative states. 4) Remove multiple citizen identification mechanisms and instead consolidate all citizen information under Aadhar card including linkage of bank a/c’s etc to the same. 5) Deploy our software talent for devising hacking proof payment systems / encryption tech so as to give confidence to citizens to embrace e-banking. 6) Train up citizens on e-payments to prevent them from being defrauded of their hard earned money in pursuit of cash less society through TV programs etc.",
