BY USING THE THUMBFLY TECHNOLOGIES SOFTWARE, YOU ARE AGREEING TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE, DO NOT\nINSTALL AND/OR USE THE SOFTWARE.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: To the extent that this software may be used to reproduce materials, it is licensed to you only for reproduction of noncopyrighted\nmaterials, materials in which you own the copyright, or materials you are authorized or legally permitted to reproduce. If you are uncertain about your right to copy any material, you should contact your legal advisor.\n\n1. General.\n(a) The ThumbFly Technologies Text Messaging software, content, documentation and any fonts included in the Software (collectively the \"ThumbFly Technologies Software\") are licensed, not sold, to you by ThumbFly Technologies, LLC (“ThumbFly Technologies”) for use only under the terms of this License. ThumbFly Technologies and/or ThumbFly Technologies's licensors retain ownership of the ThumbFly Technologies Software itself and reserve all rights not expressly granted to you. The terms of this License will govern any software upgrades provided by ThumbFly Technologies that replace and/or supplement the original ThumbFly Technologies Software product, unless such upgrade is accompanied by a separate license in which case the terms of that license will govern.\n\n(b) From time to time, ThumbFly Technologies may release software updates to the version of ThumbFly Technologies Software you originally purchased. ThumbFly Technologies will provide you any such updates that it may release up to, but not including, the next major release of the ThumbFly Technologies Software, for free. For example, if you originally purchased version 1.X of the ThumbFly Technologies Software, ThumbFly Technologies would provide you for free any software updates it might release (e.g. version 1.2 or 1.3) up to, but not including, version 2.X of the ThumbFly Technologies Software.\n\n2. Permitted License Uses and Restrictions.\n(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this License and as permitted in the \"Usage Rules\" set forth in the Google Play Terms and Conditions, you are granted a limited non-transferable license to install and use the ThumbFly Technologies Software on any Android-branded mobile device that you own or control. You may not distribute or make the ThumbFly Technologies Software available over a network where it could be used by multiple devices at the same time. You may not rent, lease, lend,\nsell, redistribute or sublicense the ThumbFly Technologies Software.\n\n(b) You may not and you agree not to, or to enable others to, copy (except as expressly permitted by this License and the \"Usage Rules\"), decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, decrypt, modify, or create derivative works of the ThumbFly Technologies Software or any services provided by the ThumbFly Technologies Software, or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent any foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable law or to the extent as may be permitted by the licensing terms governing use of any open sourced components included with the ThumbFly Technologies Software). Any attempt to do so is a violation of the rights of ThumbFly Technologies and its licensors of the ThumbFly Technologies Software.\n\n(c) The ThumbFly Technologies Software may be used to reproduce materials so long as such use is limited to reproduction of non-copyrighted materials, materials in which you own the copyright, or materials you are authorized or legally permitted to reproduce. Title and intellectual property rights in and to any content displayed by or accessed through the ThumbFly Technologies Software belongs to the respective content owner. Such content may be protected by copyright or other intellectual property laws and treaties, and may be subject to terms of use of the third party providing such content. This License does not grant you any\nrights to use such content. For example, any stock photographs, images, graphics, clipart, artwork or similar assets (“Digital Imagery”) that are provided by ThumbFly Technologies and/or its licensors as part of the ThumbFly Technologies Software or Services (including but not limited to any Digital Imagery contained within templates, themes or user guides and tutorials) may not be extracted and distributed, commercially or otherwise, on a standalone basis outside of the ThumbFly Technologies Software.\n\n(d) Any financial or health information displayed by the ThumbFly Technologies Software is provided for general informational purposes only and is not intended to be relied upon as, or a substitute for, financial or medical advice. You are solely responsible for the financial or health decisions made by you and any consequences resulting therefrom, and should always seek the guidance and advice of a financial or medical professional as appropriate. Neither ThumbFly Technologies nor any of its\nlicensors guarantees the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of financial or health information appearing within the ThumbFly Technologies Software or that desired results will be obtained.\n\n3. Consent to Use of Data. You agree that ThumbFly Technologies and its subsidiaries and agents may collect, maintain, process and use diagnostic, technical and related information, including but not limited to information about your computer, system and application software, and peripherals, that is gathered periodically to facilitate the provision of software updates, product support and other services to you (if any) related to the ThumbFly Technologies Software, and to verify compliance\nwith the terms of this License. ThumbFly Technologies may use this information, as long as it is in a form that does not personally identify you, to improve our products or to provide services or technologies to you.\n\n4. Termination. This License is effective until terminated. Your rights under this License will terminate automatically or otherwise cease to be effective without notice from ThumbFly Technologies if you fail to comply with any term(s) of this License. Upon the termination of this License, you shall cease all use of the ThumbFly Technologies Software and destroy all copies, full or partial, of the ThumbFly Technologies Software. Sections 6, 7, 10 and 11 of this License shall survive any such termination.\n\n5.

Such services may not be available in all languages or in all countries. Use of the Services requires Internet access and use of certain Services requires you to accept additional terms.\n\n(b) You understand that by using any of the Services, you may encounter content that may be deemed offensive, indecent, or objectionable, which content may or may not be identified as having explicit language, and that the results of any search or entering of a particular URL may automatically and unintentionally generate links or references to objectionable material. Nevertheless, you agree to use the Services at your sole risk and that ThumbFly Technologies shall have no liability to you for content that may be found to be offensive, indecent, or objectionable.\n\n(c) Certain Services may display, include or make available content, data, information, applications or materials from third parties (“Third Party Materials”) or provide links to certain third party web sites. By using the Services, you acknowledge and agree that ThumbFly Technologies is not responsible for examining or evaluating the content, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, validity, copyright compliance, legality, decency, quality or any other aspect of such Third Party Materials or web sites.

Third Party Materials and links to other web sites are provided solely as a convenience to you.\n\n(d) You agree that the Services contain proprietary content, information and material that is owned by ThumbFly Technologies and/or its licensors, and is protected by applicable intellectual property and other laws, including but not limited to copyright, and that you will not use such proprietary content, information or materials in any way whatsoever except for permitted use of the Services or in any manner that is inconsistent with the terms of this License or that infringes any intellectual property rights of a third party or ThumbFly Technologies. No portion of the Services may be reproduced in any form or by any means. You agree not to modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute, or create derivative works based on the Services, in any manner, and you shall not exploit the Services in any unauthorized way whatsoever, including but not limited to, using the Services to transmit any computer viruses, worms, trojan horses or other malware, or by trespass or burdening network capacity. You further agree not to use the Services in any manner to harass, abuse, stalk, threaten, defame or otherwise infringe or violate the rights of any other party, and that ThumbFly Technologies is not in any way responsible for any such use by you, nor for any harassing, threatening, defamatory, offensive, infringing or illegal messages or transmissions that you may receive as a result of using any of the Services.\n\n(e) In addition, Services and Third Party Materials that may be accessed from, displayed on or linked to from the ThumbFly Technologies Software are not available in all languages or in all countries. ThumbFly Technologies makes no representation that such Services and Materials are appropriate or available for use in any particular location. To the extent you choose to access such Services or Materials, you do so at your own initiative and are responsible for compliance with any applicable laws, including but not limited to applicable local laws. ThumbFly Technologies and its licensors reserve the right to change, suspend, remove, or disable access to any Services at any time without notice. In no event will ThumbFly Technologies be liable for the removal of or disabling of access to any such Services. ThumbFly Technologies may also\nimpose limits on the use of or access to certain Services, in any case and without notice or liability.\n\n6. Disclaimer of Warranties.\n6.1 If you are a customer who is a consumer (someone who uses the ThumbFly Technologies Software outside of your trade, business or profession), you may have legal rights in your country of residence which would prohibit the following limitations from applying to you, and where prohibited they will not apply to you. To find out more about rights, you should contact a local consumer advice organization.\n\n6.2 YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, USE OF THE THUMBFLY TECHNOLOGIES SOFTWARE AND SERVICES IS\nAT YOUR SOLE RISK AND THAT THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO SATISFACTORY QUALITY, PERFORMANCE, ACCURACY AND EFFORT IS WITH YOU.\n\n6.3 TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE THUMBFLY TECHNOLOGIES SOFTWARE AND SERVICES ARE PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITH ALL FAULTS AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, AND THUMBFLY TECHNOLOGIES AND THUMBFLY TECHNOLOGIES'S LICENSORS (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS \"THUMBFLY TECHNOLOGIES\" FOR THE PURPOSES OF SECTIONS 6 AND 7) HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE THUMBFLY TECHNOLOGIES SOFTWARE AND SERVICES, EITHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR\nSTATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY, OF QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS.\n\n6.4 THUMBFLY TECHNOLOGIES DOES NOT WARRANT AGAINST INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR ENJOYMENT OF THE THUMBFLY TECHNOLOGIES SOFTWARE OR SERVICES, THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE THUMBFLY TECHNOLOGIES SOFTWARE OR SERVICES WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, THAT THE OPERATION OF THE THUMBFLY TECHNOLOGIES SOFTWARE OR SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, THAT THE THUMBFLY TECHNOLOGIES SOFTWARE OR SERVICES WILL BE COMPATIBLE WITH THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE THUMBFLY TECHNOLOGIES SOFTWARE OR SERVICES WILL BE CORRECTED.\n\n6.5 YOU FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE THUMBFLY TECHNOLOGIES SOFTWARE AND SERVICES ARE NOT INTENDED OR SUITABLE FOR USE IN SITUATIONS OR\nENVIRONMENTS WHERE THE FAILURE OF, OR ERRORS OR INACCURACIES IN THE CONTENT, DATA OR INFORMATION PROVIDED BY, THE THUMBFLY TECHNOLOGIES SOFTWARE OR SERVICES COULD LEAD TO DEATH, PERSONAL INJURY, OR SEVERE PHYSICAL OR ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE\nOPERATION OF NUCLEAR FACILITIES, AIRCRAFT NAVIGATION OR COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS, AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL, LIFE SUPPORT OR WEAPONS SYSTEMS.\n\n6.6 NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY THUMBFLY TECHNOLOGIES OR A THUMBFLY TECHNOLOGIES AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY. SHOULD THE THUMBFLY TECHNOLOGIES SOFTWARE OR SERVICES PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR LIMITATIONS ON APPLICABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS OF A CONSUMER, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION AND LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n7. Limitation of Liability. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL THUMBFLY TECHNOLOGIES BE LIABLE FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS,\nCORRUPTION OR LOSS OF DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR ANY OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE THUMBFLY TECHNOLOGIES SOFTWARE OR SERVICES, HOWEVER CAUSED, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY (CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) AND EVEN IF THUMBFLY TECHNOLOGIES HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

In no event shall ThumbFly Technologies's total liability to you for all damages (other than as may be required by applicable law in cases involving personal injury) exceed the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00). The foregoing limitations will apply even if the above stated remedy fails of its essential purpose.\n\n8. Export Control.
