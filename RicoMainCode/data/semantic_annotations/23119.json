The now-fertilized egg is currently in one of your fallopian tubes merging with the sperm to become a zygote, where cell division is occuring at an incredibly rapid rate.\n\nYour little zygote will spend the next 7-10 days dividing and growing as they travel down to your uterus, where they'll nestle into your cozy blood-rich uterine wall.\n\nThe implantation process may result in a little spotting for some women, which is caused by the sloughing off of uterine wall at the implantation site. This is perfectly natural and not a cause for concern. When your little zygote is finally implanted, it is officially considered a \"blastocyst\" measuring about 0.1-0.2 mm.\n\nLong story short: this week is the beginning of your child's life.\n\nAnd how's mom doing?\n\nYour body can already sense the presence of your microscopic bean-baby and has begun producing Early Pregnancy Factor (EPF) protein, an immunosuppressant which prevents your body from rejecting your growing zygote. What's more, you'll continue to produce estrogen and progesterone thereby suppressing ovulation.\n\nYou won't express any other of the main symptoms of pregnancy at this point, but soon your hormones will be fluctuating more intensely than any other time in your life.\n\nSo yeah, you won't be feel nauseous this early in the ball-game, but get ready: soon your hormones will be fluctuating more intensely than anything you've experienced before and you and everyone close to you will be noticing.\n\nIf you've been planning this pregnancy by monitoring your morning basal body temperature, you will see that your temperature remains elevated beyond day 16 of your Luteal Phase (post ovulation). This will be the first verifiable sign that you're pregnant!\n\nDid You Know?\n\nThe Center for Disease Control estimates that if every woman of child-bearing age consumed 400 micrograms of vitamin B folic acid daily for at least a month before conception, there would be a 50% decrease in the number of babies born with neural tube defects (spinal cord disorders such as spina bifida and anencephaly). \n\n",
