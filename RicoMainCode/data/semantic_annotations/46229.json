For example, you could take an illustration of the Palm House Royal Botanical Gardens from an 1852 issue of 'The Illustrated London News' and pair it with a 1902 old print of the Coronation Bazaar Botanical Gardens from 'The Graphic.' Or, you could opt for botanical prints from James Sowerby, which are hand colored. A wonderful and inexpensive way to use botanical prints in budget decorating is to create a triptych (a set of three) of Sowerby's detailed drawings that are matted and framed.",

For example, if you're a theatre buff and are decorating the room that contains your entertainment center, prints depicting actors from the Lyceum Theater in London or even theatre reviews from newspapers and magazines from that era would provide a striking contrast to your flat screen, HDTV.",
